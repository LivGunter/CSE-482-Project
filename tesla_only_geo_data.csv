Sponsors:  [Vocal Seniority and Indivisible Sisters](https://thevocalseniority.org/)

Tesla Takedown, a national movement to hit Elon Musk in the pocketbook, continues to grow nationwide. As special March 29 protest organized by the national **Tesla Takedown movement drew 82 participants in Bend.** Protests in Bend have been ongoing since late February and will continue every Tuesday at 5:00 p.m. at the [Tesla dealership](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Xd2KpuiGAMqNdjv78), 63040 N Hwy 97.

PC Mag reported on March 30 that ""Amid widespread backlash against his businesses, Elon Musk this week teased a late spring exit from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)....Musk's DOGE activity has had a particularly adverse effect on Tesla. A report from YouGov found that Americans are now 12.8% more likely to have a negative than a positive opinion of Tesla, with this rising to 35% among those who describe themselves as liberals.""

Vocal Seniority member Jerry Freilich, who has attended the Bend Tesla protests since the beginning, wants to make it clear that the intent is not to hurt anyone in the community or damage any vehicles.

""We have no hard feelings for Tesla owners, our Tesla dealer, or anyone else except Elon Musk,"" he says. ""We're committed to doing everything we can to take him down financially, and will work toward that goal as long as he has the power to hurt our country. These protests are the only weapon we have. They're the only weapon we want.""

1kiem7,Why I say that auto drivers are just as bad (or worse) than the cyclists in Pittsburgh,"Today, while bicycling my three mile commute to work from Squirrel Hill to Oakland I experienced:

* One person yelling at me to get off the road.
* Three people passing me so close I could touch their cars.
* Having to slam on my brakes to not hit a person making a ""Pittsburgh Left"" in front of me.
* Four people driving cars in a bike lane.
* One person tailgating me closer than a car length because I was only traveling 27 mph on a 25 mph road and there wasn't room for the person to pass me.

And while I don't normally see as many of these things on a single ride, not a one of them is remotely unusual.

This is why I find it very difficult to find sympathy with all of the people complaining about cyclists on the road.  There are lots of automobile drivers out there who are actively endangering my life on a daily basis.  This is what I mean by the statement that automobile drivers are often worse than the cyclists on the road.

While I pedantically try to follow state law on my daily commute I can certainly sympathize with the cyclists who don't follow the letter of the law so that they can avoid interactions with automobiles (though I have few sympathies for the people who ignore the rules altogether).",pittsburgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/1kiem7/why_i_say_that_auto_drivers_are_just_as_bad_or/,8/16/2013 20:45,52,93,pennsylvania

1ljkel,Need help from Electrical Engineer to troubleshoot Tesla Coil,"I'm the proud owner of one of these: http://onetesla.com/

Prior to yesterday, I had only soldered copper pipes and audio cables. I bought a solder practice kit, did that, and proceeded to build the Tesla Coil.

I'm an EE noob, my solders are 80% good, 20% questionable. I was able to perform the low voltage testing on the Midi Interrupter without any issues, but when I went to test the Coil's PCB (at low voltage) I started to smell electrical fire and immediately unplugged it.

I have no idea where to go next without someone much smarter than I in the ways of EE. I can trade homebrew, help with programming (homework/website/anything, programming is how I make my money) or just hard cash if that's what you need to come give me a hand :)

TL;DR: I Suck at EE, need help to fix tesla coil.

1ryu8f,There is a bill trying to stop Tesla from building dealerships in Ohio,"The vote for SB 137 has been pushed up to tomorrow!

> The Dealers in Ohio are working hard to pass legislation to prevent Tesla from selling vehicles in your state. As a Tesla advocate in Ohio we need your help now. This legislation, SB 137, would change existing law to exclude Tesla from opening or operating any additional facilities in Ohio. Make no mistake – this bill would prevent Tesla from opening stores and service locations in Ohio!

> Tesla is putting boots on the ground to fight for consumer choice – and you too can play a part TODAY.

> Please contact the Governor, the Speaker of the House, the Senate President, your local Senator and state Assemblyman, and let them know that you want Tesla to stay and grow in Ohio! Please join us and other Tesla Advocates at the Capitol for the House Transportation, Public Safety, and Homeland Security Committee hearing on December 4, 2013 to show your support for Tesla and against SB 137.


* There are more than 250 Tesla Roadster and Model S owners in Ohio with more joining our community every week.
 
* Ohio companies supplied well over $10 million in parts and components this year to build Model S vehicles in the United States, with that number expected to double by this time next year.

* With a service center in Dublin and stores opening in Columbus and Cincinnati this month, Tesla will support 26 employees, and every location will add an initial $7 million in direct economic activity to the State. Tesla will be banned from creating additional jobs, opening new locations and bringing substantial economic investment from a U.S. company to Ohio if this legislation passes.

* Tesla intends to install a number of Superchargers to enable long distance travel in the State before the end of the year to support the growing number of Tesla owners in the region.",Columbus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/1ryu8f/there_is_a_bill_trying_to_stop_tesla_from/,12/3/2013 3:50,110,52,ohio

Unity is a small church just south of Grand on 31st Street, next to Des Moines University. We've recently converted to a multi-use venue ([pictures](http://imgur.com/a/OFp0X))
, and we're testing out our new space by putting on a Spring Concert Series!

The first concert is tomorrow night, Friday the 11th at 8PM. We'll be having the extremely talented guitarist James Biehn out for an acoustic show, with Rainbow Penley and Jeremy Alvarez opening up, should be a great show! I'll post event details and bios below, but they're also available on any of the event pages. 

This is an all-ages show. Doors open at 7:00 on Friday, and the show starts at 8:00 with Rainbow and Jeremy. Tickets are $7 on Eventbrite (we're absorbing the fees, so it'll actually be $7!), and $10 at the door. Wine and beer will be available to purchase for anyone over the age of 21 with a valid ID.

It should be noted that, while Unity is a church on Sundays, you shouldn't concern yourself with maintaining any particular church standards. We just want you to treat it like any concert, have fun!

I'll answer any questions you have, just comment or PM me and I'll get right back to you. It would be great if we could get a good turnout to support these great local musicians, as well as our new venue.

BIO FOR JAMES BIEHN:

James M. Biehn got his first taste of music when he began playing the trumpet at the age of 10. He picked up a guitar shortly after and by the age of 13 was a featured soloist in the school jazz band. He continued playing guitar at Norwalk High School where he won multiple soloist awards and helped the band win first place in the state competition two years in a row.

Continuing his musical studies at Southwestern Community College in Creston, IA, under the direction of Grammy-nominated department head Phil Mattson, James became proficient in music theory, jazz keyboard, and big band/vocal arranging.

Throughout his high school and college years, James balanced his schoolwork with the rigors of recording and performing with his first band, the McKenzies. The band released two albums, “A Collective Sigh of Relief” and “Cold in September,” which collectively sold more than 2,000 copies.

He first began teaching guitar in 1998 at Ground Zero Music in Indianola, IA. By 2001 he had officially quit his “day job” and has been teaching guitar and bass guitar full time ever since.

In 2005, James was the winner of Lazer 103.3’s “Guitar Battle,” which earned him the opportunity to play onstage with the band Tesla. For two years running he was the regional winner in Guitar Center’s King of the Blues guitar competition.

In 2009, James opened his own music lesson studio, Central Iowa Music Lab. Today, “The Lab” boasts a roster of over 200 students. Instruction is given in almost every musical endeavor including: Guitar, Bass Guitar, Drums, Piano, Voice, and much more. More can be found at http://www.centraliowamusiclab.com./

Besides his dedication to the local music scene and his many students, James is a devoted husband and father of three boys.

When he left my house Saturday he said I would only be watching Tesla for a week or 2 but he told me Sunday that he was out of town/couldn't get a ride to my place until the 1st. 

As far as the people that looking to adopt him I want to talk it over with an attorney first to see what course of action I should take. I have no doubt in my mind that anybody would be a better owner than Steve but I want to talk it over first before doing anything that might come back on me. I also have to file a lawsuit in small claims court for the rent/late fees/damages he owes. I'll update this post after I speak with my attorney tomorrow.

2nni03,Today I'm thankful for ComED. No… seriously.,"This is the first Thanksgiving my wife and I have had no family plans. We decide to do Thanksgiving with just the two of us. We've never done this before so we're excited and a little nervous.

Jump to Thanksgiving Day and the turkey's been in the oven for about 45 minutes. It's just after 1pm and I'm cleaning, she's prepping sides, and the power goes out. It's eerily calm; ain't nothing electrical going on in this building.

I call ComED the first time (about 1:15)  and they said we were 2 of over 3400 on the far north side to be without power. Some panicked Facebook posts and a call to the Butternut Turkey hotline reassured us that food safety wasn't an issue until at least 4 hours had passed.

I call ComED again at 2:15 and 3:15 is still the estimate to get power back. At 2:40 the lights and the forced heat come back on and my wife of just under a year runs over to the turkey.

Turns out everything was fine and we had a slightly delayed, yet still great, 1st Thanksgiving as a married couple.

Because of this I not only wanted to post a really boring story on /r/Chicago, but I also wanted to publicly thank that person who had to work on a holiday. If it wasn't for this man/woman, I would've been dealing with a ridiculously depressed me and a devastated wife all afternoon.

Seriously, I'm thankful for all the poor men and women who have to work today. I wish you didn't, but sometimes you're all that stand between a man, his new wife, and complete chaos.

34ilml,Does anyone know if electricity rates fluctuate depending on time of day in Georgia?,"In this article/video, Tesla's Kimball Musk claims that electricity is actually cheaper to buy at, say, 3 am, than 1 pm, which is why Tesla's new battery could end up saving homeowners money on their bill if they have it installed. But he talks about this in reference specifically for California.   I tried to find out if GA Power's rates had a similar structure, but got nowhere. Does anyone know? Thanks!

3g351h,Voodoo Homestead Sunday Game Night,"Last Week:

There were games.  Tesla vs. Edison, Tsuro of the Seas, Elder Sign, Smash Up, King of Tokyo, Broom Service, and Suburbia, to name a few.  I was impressed with how fun the Tsuro sequel managed to make everyone's swift and often random deaths.  For the most part, games went quickly enough that nobody had a chance to get too attached to living.  I'd definitely like to play some more Broom Service and Suburbia at some point now that I have a better idea of how the games work -- seems like there are definitely more strategies to explore.  And Smash Up was pretty straightforward, but the blending of deck themes and their associated strategies seemed to work really well both mechanically and flavor-wise.  Despite losing, I was pretty satisfied with my ghost bears.


This Week:

I'm out of town, but game night lives on.  If everyone could keep from having too much fun without me, I'd appreciate it.  3-10pm Sunday.  BYOFood (pizza/sandwich shop across the street).  BYOGames, or if you see people playing games when you get there, feel free to introduce yourselves and join in the next one.

See everybody next week!",pittsburgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/3g351h/voodoo_homestead_sunday_game_night/,8/7/2015 3:11,13,3,pennsylvania

3pnrnb,Live near Wrigley? Forced to commute by car? Dreading parking after the game tonight/tomorrow? I've got a free spot for you.,"Obviously everyone is taking (their cars) to the streets so they can sell their alley spots to folks who are driving in to watch the Cubs.  Which means there's even less street parking than usual.

I am (sort of) one of those people.  We bought three days of parking a couple miles away for my boyfriend's car, which means that while our parking spot will be filled during the game (it was filled with a Tesla last night!!), afterwards it will sit empty.  Although I'm very anti-car-commuting, I understand it is somehow a necessity for some people, and it will be super hard to find street parking tonight and tomorrow night.

So, if you 

1) Get home from work (or whatever) after the baseball game ends (and the person who is renting the spot leaves)

2) Live near Kenmore/Grace || Kenmore/Waveland 

3) Don't have a reserved spot you can use

Send me a PM, and I'll tell you the address so you can park for free overnight.  There's only room for one car, though it is a big spot and can fit any vehicle.

If anybody else wants to make a similar offer, you're more than welcome to do so in the comments :)

3zf7kl,Metro Detroit Predictions for 2016,"Here are some of my predictions for 2016, leaving out sports. Please add yours to the list! 

1. Someone, probably backed with foreign money (Hey Carlos Slim), announces a luxury hi-rise condo development Downtown. My guess is the block bounded by Randolph, Bates, Brush and Fort.

2. There is serious talk of a GM/FCA merger, but in the end, Sergio's attitude kills the deal.

3. Kmart is spun off of Sears and sold, at an incredibly low price, to a local Detroiter, who puts the HQ back downtown and start the slow renaissance of building that brand back up.

4. Shovels move on the Hudson block.

5. Detroit City Football Club moves into it's new home in Keyworth Stadium, and near the end of 2016, announces that it is moving into the North American Soccer League in 2017, bringing professional soccer back to Detroit.

6. A Fortune 500 company announces that it is moving it's HQ to Downtown Detroit.

7. Detroit's violent crime rate continues to fall, murders in 2016 end right around 270, or a 10% fall. More importantly to actual Detroiters, lesser crime such as break in's and assaults show an even higher rate of decline.

8. The DPS situation finally starts getting some real attention in 2016, although there is no actual movement on it yet.

9. Trump V. Clinton, with Clinton winning almost every state, or  Rubio V. Clinton, with Rubio squeaking out a victory. 

10. Trader Joe's announces a Detroit store. 

11. This is the big one....and its timeline extends a little past 2016. As the insurance industry starts assessing buildings based on their potential exposure to rising seas and greater natural disasters, due to long term climate change, companies start looking at the location of their hard assets more closely. Due to its abundant water, relatively mild climate, and low cost of living, the Great Lakes region starts attracting massive investments in hard assets. Factories, data centers, and offices all start popping up all over Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Northern Illinois. Several high profile companies start to make noise about decamping their headquarters from Miami (due to rising oceans and the inability to insure assets at a reasonable rate), DFW, Houston and Los Angeles (heat and water access and insurance rates). The upper Midwest becomes the boom region of the mid 21st century. ",Detroit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/3zf7kl/metro_detroit_predictions_for_2016/,1/4/2016 15:31,58,67,michigan

I've committed to Columbia's CVN program starting this fall and had a few questions about it.

1) What's the typical number of classes per semester for part time programs?? 1? I'm not sure I could handle 2 classes with a full time job but it would cut down the completion time to about 2 years.

2) As an online program, I know there's probably some stigma associated with CVN. How are CVN students perceived in the SEAS grad classes? (FWIW, I was originally accepted to the traditional full time MS EE program as a Tesla Scholar, but due to financial problems had to prioritize accepting a job. Since my workplace (Cali) was nowhere near NYC, I requested a transfer to the CVN program). I know the CVN FAQ states that there's no difference on the diploma and transcript, but is there a larger drawback to being a remote student? For one, I had to give up the Tesla Scholarship and the financial aid that came with it :(",columbia,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbia/comments/4n48e7/cvn_questionshow_many_classes_for_a_part_time/,6/8/2016 9:48,2,5,newyork

I was with three friends visiting your excellent city this weekend and *may* have spotted a Tesla Model 3 in the wild around Sunday at 9am.

We only got a brief look at it bombed around a left turn from N Michigan to W Randolph (NW corner of Millennium Park). Did anyone else see this or know anything about it? 

I say *may* have been a sighting because while I've seen plenty of Model X's, this could simply be a case of mistaken identity. It may have been a Model X that just looked kinda small due to the facts that it was only a brief glimpse, it was a large, empty street, it was downhill from us, and we *may* have been each sporting our very own hangover.

8je5m9,"PSA: You cannot ride Bird on the Beltline, the Sidewalk, in tandem, without a helmet, or if you're under 18 years old.","Over the last week, I've seen around 100 renters on birds \(rough estimate\) and noticed some common trends...

\- Only **one** person wore a helmet while riding their bird:  Come on... this is common sense.  If you fall off the bird, you're going to crack your skull open at 15 miles per hour. While the title of this post may make some believe I'm claiming it's a law, I'm not.  It's only required if you're less than 16 years old \(which is against the ToS\)

\- Approximately **five** of those rentals were being used by really young kids \(who weren't wearing helmets\).  Not only is this illegal \(helmets required for \<16\), this is also against Bird's TOS.  It clearly states you must be an adult to rent the birds.  Parents, stop allowing your kids to rent the bird.

\- Approximately **five** rentals were in tandem \(three with kids, one with a father / son, one with a couple\).  Don't ride the Bird in tandem.  These things aren't designed to hold two people up right, and you could potentially wreck.

~~\- The beltline explicitly prohibits motorized vehicles. Bird has a motor, and it's classified as a vehicle under state law.  This is self explanatory.~~ This is still against ToS of Bird.  It's apparently legal under state law and acceptable according to the belt line. 

\- Nearly **99\%** of all riders I've seen ride on the sidewalk.  This isn't legal under GA state law.  A bird is considered a Vehicle, and you must operate it on the road.

\- You should follow vehicular traffic laws... i.e. stop at stop signs, don't go when the light is red, signal your turn signals, etc.

\- Do not park the Bird in the middle of the sidewalk.  Park it near the bike rack, a pole, or next to the sidewalk.  Leaving it in the middle creates dangerous conditions for pedestrians. \(Thanks tesseract2012\)

I am PhD student from Czech republic, here in SD for a week to attend ASHG conference. I have first two days for tourist attractions - I have been in Zoo ( 10/10 ), on USS Midway (10 / 10), riding a Bird. But I always wanted to have a ride in Tesla. Is there any way, how to make it possible? I dont want to drive, because I dont have international driving license (only EU), but I would like to try it out. Is there any service like Lyft or Uber where can I choose a car, or something like that? I dont need a free ride.

&#x200B;

And if you have any tips for \*must see\* places, that are hidden for regular tourist please post them for me :)

9oz49b,What's the best haunted house to visit?,"Hey there! For two years, I was part of enigma haunt, down in Florida, which I consider to be the best haunted house in the world. Yes I am biased, and hell yeah I'm proud for working there. Recently, I moved up here, and my current schedule pretty much prevents me from doing a full on volunteer job at a haunted house. But that doesn't mean I don't want to visit one, quite the opposite. I recently got a email from a former coworker detailing some of the ones that are up here. I should know that all three are technically press releases or advertising, so I really don't know which one to trust. I've heard not great things about Sloss furnaces haunted house, so that might put me off.


The three I know about are:

Sloss Fright Furnace – Sloss Fright Furnace creates a terrifying experience that takes you into the deepest, darkest parts of the furnace. The frightening history of Sloss Fright Furnace is perhaps one of the reasons it is is listed as one of the top 100 places in the world for paranormal activity. Over the course of its history, thousands of workers lost their lives due to accidents, explosions and perhaps even murder. (Side note, it feels really shity to advertise your haunted house using the deaths of actual people who work there.)

Warehouse 31 – Prepare yourself for the most intense and frightening haunted house of your life as you make your way through nearly 39,000 square feet of twisting, turning and terrifying indoor horrors. While you wait to enter the trails of Warehouse 31, you can relax at our Monsters Midway, purchase food and drinks or watch a classic horror movie projected on a big screen. 

Atrox Factory – Industrial Strength Horror! Atrox Factory is the largest indoor haunted attraction in the Southeast. 50,000 square feet of mind numbing terror and over 1/4 mile of twisted hallways and shocking surprises.

9pexfw,Michigan Tech Startup? Are you joking? - The true tech startup scene in Michigan / Ann Arbor,"Before writing this post, I literally search “Michigan Startups” on Reddit, There is 0 subreddit group result, The closest one is[ Ann Arbor Startups](https://www.reddit.com/r/annarborstartups/) with 22 subscribers and the last post was 2 years ago. Put into perspective, there is a subreddit group called [Michigan Beer](https://www.reddit.com/r/michiganbeer/new/) with 5,000 subscribers and the last post was 10 hours ago

I think that can somehow give us a picture what the startup scene looks like in Michigan

Before sharing my tech startup experience, let me tell a little bit about myself. I am a software developer and moved to Michigan from California a couple of years ago. The reason for moving was for work at that time. I  had experience generating startup ideas, turning it to a product (software, or a mobile app) and running and growing to a sustainable business. I most of the times stay in Oakland County or Ann Arbor area.

&#x200B;

***Let’s start with Smart Zone***

I assume if you are in the startup field in Michigan, you probably heard about [Smart Zone](https://www.michiganbusiness.org/globalassets/documents/reports/fact-sheets/mismartzonefactsheet.pdf) . It is basically a concept that the whole Michigan is divided into 20 areas and each area has a business service center to help ambitious entrepreneurs start or grow their businesses. Some of them even have an incubator program to provide you with some business and financial related seminars..

Ironically, if you are in tech such as software / mobile / internet, you are screwed, because none of these smart zone centers support a legit tech startup. Why? Because their goals are to increase job opportunities and support some native industries such as defense, automotive, mobility things. As a tech startup, you probably want to stay lean as long as possible and will not hire anyone besides paying yourself and your co-founders until you start making good money.

&#x200B;

***Incubator / Accelerator***

Michigan surprisingly has accelerator programs. To name a few:  Desai and Sparks in Ann Arbor, Conquer in Lansing, and TechTown in Detroit

However, from the location, you may already figured these accelerators are tied to universities: U of M is in Ann Arbor, Michigan State University is in Lansing, Wayne State University is in Detroit. These programs are mostly for students in these universities or for their alumina. For other people, it is very hard to get in. Even if you get in, the outcomes will not be as good as you may think (more on this later) Also, to be honest, it is not worth the effort to try to get in when you have other great accelerators out there such as Y Combinator, AngelPad, TechStars which can truly help you grow, build relationship with investors and offer valuable advice.

&#x200B;

***Investors and advisors***

Very straightforward, First, there are not many angel investors who actively look for startups to invest. There are some VC and I guess they gathered money from rich individuals like doctors, lawyers to fund some companies. Accelerators usually play the angel roles, but I got inside information that so many startups in the accelerators were founded by local university students and failed so quickly. Accelerators end up losing money.(That’s why you do not find many accelerators / incubator programs in Michigan, it is a losing-money business and they do not get the return on their investments)

VCs are super conservative, and most of them only invest in automotive, food, real estate, and other traditional business. I know a few who invest in tech company but only limited to enterprise software because Michigan still has the biggest automotive industry with OEMs and Suppliers, their internal software is not good.

If you are making some tech product customers, you will not likely to raise money from VC in Michigan.

Also, there are so many advisors anywhere, they are on the board or this or that startups. They are helpful in their own domains such as legal, finance, etc, but few of them had run startup themselves, so their startup advice doesn’t carry much weight

&#x200B;

***Developers v.s. Entrepreneurs***

There is always a dilemma you need to solve if you want to start a tech startup in Michigan. “Entrepreneurs and developers do not go hand by hand” Most entrepreneurs are non-tech people and most developers are employees without entrepreneurial spirits. For example, in Michigan, most successful entrepreneurs are non-tech business owners ranging from CEO of movie theater franchise to small bakery. Most of them do not care about tech. People in tech are mostly developers who are employed in companies ranging from 5 people studios to giant auto OEMs. Most of them are happy with their paycheck so they will not think about starting a tech startup when they can make money by doing some fairly easy work.

&#x200B;

***Ann Arbor - the tech startup hub***

If you can guess a city that is most related to tech in Michigan, Ann Arbor should be on your top list. There are many good developers I encountered in Ann Arbor. They can code and make something but they lack the entrepreneurial spirits. (You can argue about that, but that was I experienced after talking with hundreds of people) .  Most people in Michigan who get in tech is to get a good paycheck, not to start a company or change the world for better. That’s why there are many coding boot camps or schools such as Grand Circuits. (80% new developers in Detroit will tell you they are somehow associated with Grand Circuits)

Part of the reason why Ann Arbor is tech hub in Michigan is because of U of M, which is ranked very high on any university ranking sites. There is no doubt that the buildings on the campus are beautiful and the interiors are well designed. However, just like most other universities, you do not really learn many practical skills from there even if you are a computer science student. Here is my personal experience. One day, I went to one of the biggest computer labs in the CS building and asked more than 30 students there if they know how to program in Swift ( the programming language used to make native iOS apps), everyone said no. When I got back home and search their curriculum, only one course is related to mobile development. But the statics show more than 75% of people are using mobile phones for personal use compared to 40% using a desktop. So just as most other universities in the US, students are not well trained to stay up to date.

There are many great meetups, one of my favorites is AA New Tech, where every month you can see tech-related startups present their companies, then you can network with presenters. However, although the meetup place is in one of the UM Ann Arbor building, 70% of the audience are over 30 years old and from other cities outside of Ann Arbor. Very few students are in the audience.

So in short, you can say AA is the Tech Hub in Michigan, but no way near compared to Silicon Valley’s standard and hardcore entrepreneurship.

&#x200B;

***Normal people***

I had experience running my own entrepreneurship meetup with 1300+ members in Michigan and personally talked to more than 300 of them. One of the things I found out is the entrepreneurial spirit is lacking. Most people talk and dream, few take actions, very few have the grit to persevere long enough to see some results. I guess it is a big environmental issue. Michigan is a heavily industrial state with the biggest automotive industry. So most people have the industrial worker mentality and are into the Real Estate business. The process looks like this; Graduate university -> Find a decent job in big companies -> buy some mortgages -> Rent them out -> start collecting money and save salary at the same time -> hope to quit a job as soon as possible

With that working employee mentality, few people have the courage to take the leap and start their own tech startup.

&#x200B;

***Conclusion***

If you are hardcore entrepreneur, you can make it happen no matter where you are especially for tech and internet stuff. The only difference is the amount of help and the quality of the help you can get from your surroundings.

In the tech circles in Michigan, business-minded people hardly can find a committed tech co-founder to make a startup take off. Also due to the easiness at the job, most of the developers are not skillful enough to make a great product individually. (If you are skillful, you will not say you are the front or back end developer, you do everything in a tech startup). If they could, they probably will not stay in Michigan.

In my personal opinion, I do not think Michigan is the best place to start a tech startup unless you are doing something closely related to the automotive industry. Even that, you probably will not be able to compete with other tech giants on the west coast. What's new in the automotive industry? I guess self-driving car. Aren’t Google, Tesla, and Uber the lead in the self-driving car industry?

&#x200B;

***Let’s start***

Before writing this post, I literally searched “Michigan Startups” on Reddit, There is 0 subreddit group result, The closest one is[ Ann Arbor Startups](https://www.reddit.com/r/annarborstartups/) with 22 subscribers and the last post was 2 years ago. Put it into a perspective, there is another subreddit group called [Michigan Beer](https://www.reddit.com/r/michiganbeer/new/) with 5,000 subscribers and the last post was 10 hours ago.

I think that can somehow give us a sense what the startup scene looks like in Michigan

Before sharing my tech startup experience, let me tell you a little bit about myself. I am a software developer and moved to Michigan from California a couple of years ago. The reason for moving was for work at that time. I  had experience generating startup ideas, turning it to a product (software, or a mobile app) and running and growing to a sustainable business. I’m currently running a tech startup. I mostly stay in Oakland County and Ann Arbor area.

Ok, let’s get into the meat.

&#x200B;

***Smart Zone***

I assume if you are in the startup field, no matter tech or non-tech or event small business in Michigan, you probably heard about [Smart Zone](https://www.michiganbusiness.org/globalassets/documents/reports/fact-sheets/mismartzonefactsheet.pdf) .

    The difference between a startup and a small business is the scalability. For example, a local barbarshop can only serve limited amount of people in certain areas, but startups such as early stage Uber or Spanx had the potential to reach people globally

Back to smart zone,  it is basically a concept that the whole Michigan is divided into 20 areas and each area has a business service center to help ambitious entrepreneurs start or grow their businesses. Some of them even have an incubator program to provide some business and financial related seminars, lectures and other related services.

However, if you are in tech such as software / mobile / internet, you are in bad luck, because

1. To get their help especially financially, you have to register your company in certain areas in Michigan and you have to stay there for at least 2-5 years, **which is like a locked contract.** It doesn’t seem like such a big deal.  However, it will not benefit you in the long term if you choose to register in Delaware instead, which has tax advantage and better legal support for businesses
2. **They do not give you cash**. They pay for your non-technical services, such as marketing and legal stuff (note: marketing doesn’t include your Facebook or Google ads, it only pays for marketing agents’ work), Basically, the money they pay will eventually go back to their own people or people who they have connections with. So, if you are not a tech founder, or do not have a tech co-founder in your team. You are screwed because you still need money out of your own pocket to build your product.
3. You have to know the primary goal of the smart zones is to increase job opportunities and support some native industries such as defense, automotive, mobility things. As a tech startup, you probably want to stay lean as long as possible and will not hire anyone besides paying yourself and your co-founders until you start making a good amount of money. So how can you get along with them in a long term? **Different goals!!**

&#x200B;

***Incubator / Accelerator***

It is surprising that Michigan actually has accelerator programs. To name a few:  Desai and Sparks in Ann Arbor, Conquer in Lansing, and TechTown in Detroit

From these locations, you may already figure these accelerators are tied to universities: U of M is in Ann Arbor, Michigan State University is in Lansing, Wayne State University is in Detroit. These programs are mostly for students in these universities or for their alumina. It is hard for outsiders to get in, I personally tried and people who I know have the same experience. So, if you are not connected with these schools somehow, you will probably not get accepted, even if you have a great idea and a working prototype.

Even if you get in the programs, the outcomes will not be as good as you may think (more on this later).  Also, to be honest, it is not worth the effort to try to get in when you have other great accelerators out there such as Y Combinator, AngelPad, and TechStars which can truly help you grow, build strong relationships with investors and offer valuable advice.

&#x200B;

***Investors and advisors***

Very straightforward, **First, there are not many angel investors who actively look for startups to invest.** There are some VCs who I guess gathered money from rich individuals like doctors and lawyers to fund some companies. Accelerators here usually play the angel investors’ roles, but I got insider information that so many startups in the accelerators were founded by local university students and failed so quickly due to many reasons (lack of commitment, bad idea, too small of the market…).

    Personally, I believe doing a startup is a full time job, if you have a good product, you do not have other time than focusing on building and selling your product. You can not go to school / work and run your  startups at same time. That’s probably Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates dropped out of colleges to start their companies.   

So, due to the low quality of the startups they accept, these accelerators end up not getting their investments back.That’s why you do not find many accelerators / incubator programs in Michigan because it is a money-losing business.

VCs are super conservative, and most of them only invest in automotive, food, real estate, and other traditional business. I know a few who invest in tech company but only limited to enterprise software companies because Michigan still has the biggest automotive industry with OEMs and suppliers. Their internal software sucks.

If you are making some tech/digital products for end customers, you will hardly raise money from VC in Michigan. Put in this way, **if Mark Zuckerberg raise money for Facebook in Michigan 12 years ago, he probably won’t get a dime regardless of the bad economy around that time in Michigan.**

Compare to so few angel investors, there are so many advisors who are on the board of many startups. They are helpful in their own domains such as legal, finance, etc, but few of them had ever built/ grown / run a startup themselves, so their startup advice doesn’t carry much weight.

&#x200B;

***Developers v.s. Entrepreneurs***

There is always a dilemma you need to solve if you want to start a tech startup in Michigan. “Entrepreneurs and developers do not go hand by hand.” Most ambitious entrepreneurs have no tech skills and most developers are employees who have no entrepreneurial spirits. For example, in Michigan, most successful entrepreneurs / businessmen/women  are non-tech business owners ranging from CEO of a big franchise movie theater to a small bakery. Most of them do not care about tech. People in tech are mostly developers working at companies ranging from 5 people studios to giant auto OEMs. Most of them are happy with their paycheck so they will not think about starting a tech startup when they can make money by doing some fairly easy work. **So be careful about who you partner with if you can’t do something yourself.**

&#x200B;

***Ann Arbor - the tech startup hub***

If you can guess a city that is most related to tech in Michigan, Ann Arbor should be on your top of the list. There are many good developers I encountered in Ann Arbor. They can code and make something but they lack the entrepreneurial spirits as mentioned before.  **Most people in Michigan who get in tech is to get a good paycheck, not to start a company or change the world for better.** That’s why there are many coding boot camps or schools such as Grand Circus. (80% new developers in Detroit will tell you they are somehow associated with Grand Circus, and most of them start coding for the big check).

    If your main goal of starting a tech startups is to make a lot of money, you probably will fail very quickly, because money is just not a big enough motivation to push your through startup hardships. 

Part of the reason why Ann Arbor is tech hub in Michigan is because of U of M, which is ranked very high on any university ranking sites. There is no doubt that the school spends a lot of money on their buildings exteriors and interiors to attract students. However, just like most other universities, you do not really learn many practical skills from there even if you are a computer science student. Here is my personal experience. One day, I went to one of the biggest computer labs in the CS building and asked more than 30 students there if they know how to program in Swift ( the programming language used to make native iOS apps), everyone said no. When I got back home and search their curriculum, only one course is related to mobile development. However, stats show more than 75% of people are using mobile phones for personal use compared to 40% using a desktop. So just as most other universities in the US, students are not well trained to stay up to date.

There are many great meetups, one of my favorites is AA New Tech, where every month you can see tech-related startups present their companies, then you can network with presenters. However, although the meetup place is in one of the UM Ann Arbor building, 70% of the audience are over 30 years old and from other cities outside of Ann Arbor. Very few students are in the audience. Students are not well involved in the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Ann Arbor

    I feel for universities to teach entrepreneurship is like for Chipotle to sell Pizza. Because the initial purpose of public education is to train people for work, not to start a company. Even that, current universities obviously failed both ways. First, we are no longer in a industrial era and we do not need a lot of workers / employees (more than 50% of people currently are self-employeed or freelancers in the gig economy era). . Second, even if the purpose to train workers holds true, universities sill do not teach practical skills needed to perform at a job. 

So in short, you can say AA is the Tech Hub in Michigan, but no way near compared to Silicon Valley’s standard and hardcore entrepreneurship.

&#x200B;

***Common people***

I had experience running my own entrepreneurship meetup with 1300+ members in Michigan and personally talked to more than 300 of them. One of the things I found out is the entrepreneurial spirit is seriously lacking. **Most people talk a lot, few of them take actions, and very few have the grit to persevere long enough to see some results.** I guess it is a big environmental issue. Michigan is a heavily industrial state with the biggest automotive industry. So most people have the industrial worker mentality and are more interested in the traditional Real Estate business. The process looks like this; Graduate university -> Find a decent job in big companies -> Buy some mortgages -> Rent them out -> Start collecting money and save salary at the same time -> Hope to get enough money to quit a job as soon as possible

With that working employee mentality, few people have the courage to take the leap and start their own tech startup.

&#x200B;

***Bonus: what’s the best business to start in Michigan***

After observing businesses around the lower side of Michigan, you will more likely succeed if you start the following business

1. Small food joints or food trucks: because
   1. People here love food to a different level. There is countless time I see many of my friends getting ready for 2 hours, driving for 30 plus minutes and waiting for 1 hour to dine in a popular restaurant in Detroit. Not even mention I saw people post on Facebook that they waited for 2 hours in a line for some free BBQ in a food festival. (yes, there are multiple food festivals in Michigan around the year.)
   2. There is not much to do in Michigan especially during the 6+ months of winter. I guess that’s why delicious food at a local restaurants become one of the best options.
   3. You can get investment and the odds are pretty high. Quick story, this summer June 22, there was a big Small Business / Startups pitch competition called  [Quicken Loans Detroit Dem Day](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/quicken-loans-detroit-demo-day-tickets-44344603904#) where 15 entrepreneurs pitched their companies to win over 1 million dollar investment, These 15 companies are categorized into 3 different groups based on the age of the company. Each group has a tech-related startup. Guess what was the result? All 3 winners are in the food industry, Popcorn stores, bakery store, and frozen fruit plant. Did I say the last year winner was a cupcake store in Detroit too?
   4. If you keep the size small, such as selling at the farmers market at the beginning, you can make a decent amount of money and not need to worry about the operation stuff.
2. Coffee shops near universities
   1. Almost every coffee shops around college campus are full if not packed. Regardless of the taste of the coffee or whatever you are selling. If you have a cozy environment and a high-speed wifi. You are good to go.
   2. Just be careful about the revenue drop during the summer break. Even that, your business  is still in a great shape
3. More….(you may know some too, leave your recommended business to start in Michigan)

Even Paul Graham (founder of Y-Combinator) said in his blog “ [The 18 Mistakes That Kill Startups](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html)“ The number 2 mistake is the Wrong Location. In his words,

&#x200B;

>""Startups prosper in some places and not others. Silicon Valley dominates, then Boston, then Seattle, Austin, Denver, and New York. After that there's not much. Even in New York the number of startups per capita is probably a 20th of what it is in Silicon Valley. In towns like Houston and Chicago and Detroit it's too small to measure…  
>  
>…Who knows exactly how these factors combine to boost startups in Silicon Valley and squish them in Detroit, but it's clear they do from the number of startups per capita in each.”

**If you are a hardcore entrepreneur, you can make it happen no matter where you are especially for tech and internet stuff.** The only difference is the amount of help and the quality of the help you can get from your surroundings.

In my personal opinion, I do not think Michigan is the best place to start a tech startup unless you are doing something closely related to the automotive industry. Even that, you probably will not be able to compete with other tech giants on the west coast. What's new in the automotive industry? I guess self-driving car. Aren’t Google, Tesla, and Uber the leaders in the self-driving car industry?

Even Paul Graham (founder of Y-Combinator) said in his blog “ [The 18 Mistakes That Kill Startups](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html)“ The number 2 mistake is the Wrong Location. In his words,

&#x200B;

>""Startups prosper in some places and not others. Silicon Valley dominates, then Boston, then Seattle, Austin, Denver, and New York. After that there's not much. Even in New York the number of startups per capita is probably a 20th of what it is in Silicon Valley. In towns like Houston and Chicago and Detroit it's too small to measure…  
>  
>…Who knows exactly how these factors combine to boost startups in Silicon Valley and squish them in Detroit, but it's clear they do from the number of startups per capita in each.”

As someone who has not had a car in 4 years sometimes the struggle is hard. I don't need it that often so zipcar wouldn't work and friends are not apt to lend a car. Public transport isn't always a good option when you need to buy large bulk items (even like kitty litter). So Getaround has launched in our area and is like Turo.

**They are actually looking for people with cars as they have lots of demand and not enough supply - good for the car own.**

bd6903,Some questions about Salem,"I currently live in northern Nevada (Reno).  There has been a massive influx of technology companies over the last few years, including Tesla's Giga factory. This has caused housing to skyrocket. As an example, it is very common for people to put offers on houses that say ""we will give you five grand over whatever the next highest offer is"".  Or multiple offers being put on a house the day it's listed, without anyone having seen it.  We are currently renting and when our lease expires our landlord is likely to raise our rent higher than we can afford. Therefore we are considering moving and Salem is high on the list.  

With that, let's begin the list of my silly sounding questions:

This may seem like a stupid one given that we're talking about Oregon, but what is the current water situation?  Is there plenty of fresh, drinkable water for the foreseeable future?  Is the water managed wisely?  Who is the local water utility?

Don't hate, but as working parents of a two-year-old we aren’t really worried about night life. We are however very much into enjoying different cuisines.  Are there good Vietnamese, Thai, Mexican, and Indian restaurants in town?

What are employment prospects for government jobs?  Does the county and/or city hire frequently?

Speaking of local government, what are the common complaints of how the city is being managed? Are the parks being kept up? How about the roads?  I don’t really mind taxes when things are handled well, or even when they’re just not horribly mismanaged.  

Another odd one I'm sure: are mosquitoes a huge annoyance? I grew up near the Great Lakes and my childhood memories are filled with the smell of Off bug spray.  Northern Nevada hardly has any mosquitoes. My wife grew up here and has never had to contend with it whatsoever.  Will she be in for a rude awakening, or will she just need to get used to putting on some spray around dusk?

Thanks so much to anyone who takes the time to answer any of these questions, it's greatly appreciated.

Who gave you the best rates on auto insurance? What about for an auto loan?

Those have been taken care of and now I need to decide whether or not to move forward. I have a 10kw system proposed for around $30k - with an estimated 80% offset. I have heard that the AZ power companies like APS have really reduced their rates they buy electricity and implemented other tactics that make solar far less attractive. I could add a power wall and go 100% off the grid BUT I don't think the ROI stacks up there. Additionally, there has been a lot of negative PR about Telsa and their solar program.

c2b1q2,Top 10 ways NYC is better than LA.,"Is this rivalry even still a thing? Anyway, here's my list.

1. Urban planning. NYC is a grid system and the densest populated area in the country, making the city totally walkable and any part easy to access via public transportation. Los Angeles is literally the largest city in the world by land area, and it's mostly urban sprawl.

2. Landmarks and Institutions. NYC has Wall Street, the United Nations, and the Museum of Modern Art. Los Angeles probably has stuff but nothing off the top of my head.

3. Gas prices. California loves to tax their gas, add numerous regulations to gas, and it's already an importer of gas as well, making gas in Los Angeles the most expensive in the country, more expensive even than Hawaii, and between $4 and 5.29 a gallon. And it'll stay expensive because California politicians believe this'll get everyone buying expensive Tesla's and other electric vehicles.

4. Size. NYC has a population of 8.5 million and a GDP of $1.5 trillion. Los Angeles County has a population of 4 million and a GDP of less than $700 billion.

5. Diversity and integration. NYC is an international city with people and groups with backgrounds from all over the world coming together for business and life. Los Angeles is mostly Hispanic with pockets of wealthy white communities.

6. The people. You're both aholes, but surprisingly enough I found New Yorkers to be better aholes than people in Los Angeles. New Yorkers will yell at you if you're too slow or adding time to their commute, but they will never take time out of their day to continue the fight, which someone from Los Angeles would do.

7. Public transit. NYC has the best public transit in the country, Los Angeles requires car ownership.

8. Weather. It's hot in Los Angeles, at least NYC has seasons.

9. Celebrities. NYC is where celebrities go to live because they can remain relatively anonymous. Los Angeles is where people who think they deserve to be celebrities go because that's where they were told Hollywood is.

10. Industry. NYC obviously has the biggest financial industry in the country, also NYC has one of the fastest growing tech and startup sectors as well as huge and impressive schools of higher education, most notably Columbia and NYU. Los Angeles has UCLA which is still impressive, but if I could attend any school it'd be one of those two in NYC.

Don't hate the messenger, hate the data, because while Los Angeles is a great city in its own right, it is no NYC. The only thing I'd personally say Los Angeles has over NYC is more attractive people. NYC is #1 in beautiful people for East Coast hot, but that's an easy bracket as compared to West Coast hot, and in that regard Los Angeles wins.",nyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/c2b1q2/top_10_ways_nyc_is_better_than_la/,6/19/2019 1:56,0,28,newyork

* I have searched for and gone to multiple ""touchless"" car washes. They touch....a lot. Russel Speeders, Dolphin, etc. all come up when you search touchless in Omaha, but they all have brushes and spinners.
* More importantly, I can't for the life of me smoothly shift into and out of neutral in one of those automated tracks. The rollers shimmy under the wheel, causing the car to jump a little. I have to hold the brake to shift from N to D, but meanwhile the car behind me is closing in and I've had at least a couple of close calls of almost getting bumped in the back.

cqdfzq,"""When we speak of man,","we have a conception of humanity as a whole, and before applying scientific methods to the investigation of his movement we must accept this as a physical fact. But can anyone doubt to-day that all the millions of individuals and all the innumerable types and characters constitute an entity, a unit? Though free to think and act, we are held together, like the stars in the firmament, with ties inseparable. These ties cannot be seen, but we can feel them. I cut myself in the finger, and it pains me: this finger is a part of me. I see a friend hurt, and it hurts me, too: my friend and I are one. And now I see stricken down an enemy, a lump of matter which, of all the lumps of matter in the universe, I care least for, and it still grieves me. Does this not prove that each of us is only part of a whole?
For ages this idea has been proclaimed in the consummately wise teachings of religion, probably not alone as a means of insuring peace and harmony among men, but as a deeply founded truth. The Buddhist expresses it in one way, the Christian in another, but both say the same: We are all one. Metaphysical proofs are, however, not the only ones which we are able to bring forth in support of this idea. Science, too, recognizes this connectedness of separate individuals, though not quite in the same sense as it admits that the suns, planets, and moons of a constellation are one body, and there can be no doubt that it will be experimentally confirmed in times to come, when our means and methods for investigating psychical and other states and phenomena shall have been brought to great perfection. Still more: this one human being lives on and on. The individual is ephemeral, races and nations come and pass away, but man remains. Therein lies the profound difference between the individual and the whole.""

I am confused and anxious if I do get a model 3 where would I charge it ? Kansas does not have a super charger nearby. The only super charger present is 25 miles away in kansas city. I don't want to install a power wall because I lease an apartment and it does not support installing power walls in garage. Stores like walmart, khols don't have a level 3 charger that would mean leaving my car for hours there, which is not reliable. I found clean charge network in kansas which is good enough and has a  DC Fast, CHAdeMO charger which is better than level 2 but i think not as good as level 3 charger.

They have a single man that has a noticeable disability doing everything but grilling the food. He has next to no help. Tonight he was talking about how tired he was and how he didn’t have any help but it’s worth it because they gave him a raise to $10 an hour.

   Meanwhile, while he’s busting his ass, there’s this upper-management working type that roams around doing nothing. He was once chiding this same man for not working fast enough, at least until he heads out home in his Tesla.

   It doesn’t sit well with me that they’re taking advantage of the people desperate enough to deal with the constant onslaught they have at night, and it’s very apparent they’ve crunched the numbers and determined that’s the profitable thing to do.

I’m trying to plan a 5 year wedding anniversary “night on the town.”  I’ll be 8 months pregnant in November so we can’t fly anywhere but have agreed for a mini “classy” date weekend.  We have a couples massage booked from 2-3.  We have orchestra hall tickets for 8.  I need dinner suggestions for something nearish orchestra hall that has great service.  We would like to stay under $50-60 per person for the meal.  I’m all about trying new things but obviously raw food is out.  He loves fruity/fun drinks and I like anything that a bartender can make that isn’t a terrible mocktail.

We love feeling like we are classy even though husband is currently finishing up his last year in school and funds are limited.  But for example last year for his birthday I rented a Tesla for the day and we dressed up swanky and bar hopped around to fancy places getting drinks and apps.  We’ve saved up for this anniversary for a while so we want to splurge a little but PS steak is too expensive.  Hai hai is good but we want something closer to downtown.  We did Cafe Lurcat during restaurant week last year and liked it.  Hola arepa is good too but again we are looking for fancier.  I’d like to have more options on the menu than just steak.  We are not picky when it comes to food, we just like options since pregnancy can make eating difficult sometimes.

dp165t,Has anyone installed solar on their homes? How was the installation? Has there been any noticeable affect on your bills?,"I just had a meeting with a solar installer. It was informative. The electric company does buy back excess power you create but only pays 2 cents per kw(?) so you won’t be getting rich off this. The company designs a unit that will generate @60% of your needs which helps off set the costs. They say the installation will take around 4 months. There is a tax credit and not a rebate - which means rather than getting back a large check next year, you can off set what you owe up to @$11k over the next 4 years. A system with just panels will cost @$20k and with a battery raises the cost to around $33K or $24k after the tax credits. 

The way I’m looking at it, I’m paying more up front to pay less in bills over time. If I move before I pay off the unit, it’s should help with the resale price. Financing is available.

dub5vn,Interested in buying an electric vehicle? AMA!,"I did one of these a while back, and thought maybe I'd make it a semi-regular thing in order to proselytize to a wide audience. Electric vehicles are still pretty new (especially around these parts), so I did a fair amount of research before buying mine. If that research helps someone else make a decision, hooray!

I have a Chevy Volt. This is a plug-in electric hybrid (PHEV), which means it also takes gas for when the battery runs out. It has a decent, but small, electric range - about 44 miles in cool weather, closer to 40 when it's hot (AC sucks up power). This is usually more than enough for my daily commute. I only use gas on longer trips or if I've forgotten to charge. Since I bought the car several months ago, I've probably spent $30 on gas. For people who want the benefits of electric but also want to take long road trips, or who worry about evacuation, this is a great car. 

Because the ranges of these cars have improved so much, our next car will likely be a fully electric and extremely affordable Chevy Bolt; their range is over 250 miles. 

You can plug electric cars into wall outlets. The speed of the charge depends on the outlet. A 220 outlet will charge twice as quickly as a 110. We installed a little home charger station for about $300, and Entergy gave us $250 for that through its program. This charges my car in just a few hours!

Electric cars have quite a few advantages:

- Obviously, zero emissions is pretty great. 

- You save a lot of money. First, even though gas is cheap in Louisiana, electricity is always cheaper. I can spout off kilowatt hour prices at you, but the easiest way to understand it is that my fuel costs are less than half what gas costs. Second, maintenance on EVs and PHEVs is very limited compared to an internal combustion engine. EVs don't use oil or have any belts, so most maintenance for them is tires, windshield wipers, and software updates; no oil changes, ever. PHEVs also have minimal maintenance. I'll need an oil change in 18 months. I'm not sure if I'll ever need my brakes replaced, because the engine captures deceleration and moves that power to the battery, reducing the amount I break drastically.

- Many of the used ones are very, very affordable and new EV models often have great tax credits, sometimes as much as $8500, plus manufacturer incentives. You can get a Chevy Spark, which is a small car with a small range of about 80 miles, but perfectly good for toodling around town, for about $8,000. I paid $12,500, plus taxes, for my 2013 Volt with 44,000 miles on it. 

- Because manufacturers are still trying to sell consumers on EVs, they often include amazing features in even the base models. My car is 6 years old, and I've got heated seats, remote start, keyless entry, it tells me my tire pressure and exactly when I'll need an oil change - the works. The newer models are like freaking spaceships.

- All the torque is instantly available, which means acceleration is extremely fast, even with low horsepower vehicles. 

- Smooth, quiet ride. So smooth. So quiet. 

- They make stop and go traffic almost pleasant because regenerative braking means I rarely have to brake...I just sort of cruise along. 

Anyway, that's all I have for now. Feel free to ask questions. I'll answer as I can, but I'm going the game later, so I may be too busy ~~taunting dirty birds~~ weeping into my go cup to answer then.",NewOrleans,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/dub5vn/interested_in_buying_an_electric_vehicle_ama/,11/10/2019 13:02,23,49,louisiana

A certain major tech giant, which has a name starting with ""Q"", has offered to pay me low six figures to sling code for them\*!

In the process of carefully researching projected expenses vs income, I read that while you don't need AC or heat most of the time, electricity starts at 26 cents a kWh!  Ouch!

I presently drive a Prius and was thinking of getting a Tesla (like, basically everyone else I bet).  But at 26+ cents a kWh, (you'll burn way past 250 kWh a month fueling a Tesla), 257 Wh/mile, and 90% charging efficiency - that's 7.4 or more cents a mile.

A Prius, burning $4 a gallon gas at 50 mpg costs 8 cents a mile.

Are there special rates for EV charging or is this what it costs?

Beyond the stereotypes and [debatable] shady business practices, this is another reason why car dealers can't seem to gain credibility; ownership and management keep shuffling decks. Ask anyone in the auto industry; the turnover is ridiculous, even at the management level.

Now if you want a brand new Chevrolet and you live in the greater Cleveland area, Ganley is pretty much your only option (they pretty much own Serpentini too, fyi), with the exception of 3 or 4 single family owned stores.

Multiple people witnessed this and we're taking photos. After about 20 minutes pass I am headed back that way and I see the owners of the vehicle and approach them to give them my number to tell them what happened and answer any questions the police have. Luckily someone left a note on their car and gave the description as well as a license plate number of the couple. However, the owners texted me later to tell me thank you and they said the police can't do anything. How is this possible? You have a license plate number. They did thousands of dollars in damage.

fm5298,Tesla keeping employees left in the dark once again. COVID-19 | New York,"As  I grow more and more frustrated with the lack of transparency,   communication, and responsibility from HR & Managers within the New   York region, I am just wondering why they have not shut down operations   yet when there is an increasing amount of COVID-19 cases on the rise.   They state we are taking safety precautions to abide by the 'Social   Distancing' recommendations from the CDC, but I can assure you that is   not the case. We are sending people out on test drives by themselves and   often forget to sterilize the car they were in including the keys we   hand to them. We are forgetting to do this because the amount of volume   we have with limited staff due to most of the employees not coming in   because either they're sick, or don't feel comfortable coming into work   due to the spread. We have managers making ""secret work from home""   schedules being sent out to managers only, without their employees   seeing it because 'I don't want it to be public knowledge that we're   letting people work from home bc everyone will ask to do it.' - **Manager**.

As of today, head of HR sent this email attached stating to reach out  this  new email alias for questions relating to COVID-19, instead of  just  being upfront and transparent. Why do we have to fish for the  answers  when our local governments are telling us very clear, and  concise  directives?

g4uujg,hybrid vehicle performance in Minneapolis?,"Hi everyone. I am moving to Minneapolis from a warmer climate and am thinking about getting a hybrid car. I am still working out my budget so I don't have any price points to share, but I am just doing some background research to help me in my decision making. I also do not yet know where I'll be living, but I plan to live within Minneapolis or nearby suburbs (not in the country), so I plan to mostly do city/highway driving. Figured this would be a good place to get some info to be prepared when I go to the dealership.

Being from a warmer climate, I do not have firsthand experience with hybrid sedans/ SUVs (or any car, for that matter) in cold parts of the country. I would imagine with the population of Minneapolis, there are at least a few hybrids on the roads. If anyone has experience with driving/owning a hybrid in the winter in Minneapolis, can you please share any downsides you've experienced that are due to the region, weather, or vehicle? Are there specific things about hybrids or their performance to keep in mind when getting one in Minneapolis/St. Paul?

What I've gathered thus far is that the battery will likely not last as long in the extreme cold and the gas side is used more often, which increases fuel consumption. However, I am more curious if there are features that do not work in the winter due to running more on the gas side that might not be obvious (perhaps things like heated seats, FWD or AWD, eco mode, ABS, etc).

I've looked through this sub as well as [r/TwinCities](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwinCities/) and [r/minnesota](https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/) and didn't find anyone addressing my question, but apologies if I missed something and this has been asked before. I was reading a few threads about hybrids in [r/Edmonton](https://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/) since I know it's also cold there, but didn't find much other than what I said before. I also thought asking here would be more relevant to me since I'm moving to the area.

gbn3zy,PeachPass BS & Help,"June of last year I took delivery of a Tesla Model 3. One of the first things I did was to get my PeachPass as I travel from Buford to Atlanta and Atlanta to Buford everyday. I also obtained AFV tags.

A couple weeks ago I received a Toll Violation in the mail of $3,000. The tolls and fees dated all the way of June last year when I started using PeachPass.

I called them up and after further investigation I mistyped a letter in my license plate (I swear the ""1"" looked like an ""I"" to me). They gracefully removed the fines but they still want me to pay the tolls of $300. On top of that my registration is due next month of $268.

I am willing to pay some amount as I did make a mistake of typing the wrong letter in however not the full amount as I believe I should've been notified earlier and NOT A YEAR LATER. On top of this the don't even mention the fact that  I have to place my car in non-toll mode as I have AFV tags.

They are not budging on the tolls. What else can I do have them help me? Has anyone been through anything like this?

ghuqp2,Commute from Atlanta to Athens - Where to live??,"Hey everyone!

My partner and I recently graduated from our respective programs and are looking for neighborhoods to rent apartments or townhomes. I will start work in Atlanta and he's going to work in Athens and we already know the commute aspect is going to be the biggest challenge for us. We're both relatively young and have a preference to live closer to the Atlanta side (at least for the next couple years) and find a nice apartment.

The questions we have:

(1) For anyone who currently does this commute from Atlanta to Athens, how long does it take you from where you live? How early do you leave home to avoid the worst traffic?

(2) What neighborhoods do you recommend? Right now we have our eyes on apartments/townhomes in Chamblee, Brookhaven and North Buckhead right now. As per google maps, all three of these areas take around 1h - 1h30 to get to Athens in the morning.

Strangely enough, when looking at google maps, it seems to make very little difference to the commute time to Athens when we look at neighborhoods further away from Atlanta (Suwannee, Duluth, etc) but the commute time really increases from these neighborhoods to Atlanta. That's why we figured it might be better to live closer to Atlanta.

Thank you!!

———————————-
UPDATE:

Thank you for all the responses! 

Living as close to the i-85 was the best advice and that really helped us narrow our options. We ended up living close to the North Druid Hills area and the commute has been around 1hr to 1.10hr.

gpv8tu,Missed Connection: Tall Tesla driving male flying a remote controlled plane over at Vista Ridge High School last Tuesday (I know this is a long shot),"I MUST know what it was you were flying!

Last week (maybe Tuesday) , you were flying some sort of super fast tiny plane (drone?) over Vista Ridge High School with what I’m assuming was cockpit view googles on. Your dark grey Tesla has red calipers. If you are on here or anyone knows you..... I NEED it in my life.  I’m not familiar with the remote control plane world and I can’t figure out the right search words. 

Also, if anyone else knows of a similar craft let me know. There were googles involved which I assume is the view from the cockpit. The craft was pretty fast and the fuselage was hollow (I think) minus what kind of looked like 2 circular fans. I couldn’t see a fin or stabilizers  but it was definitely doing tons of roll maneuvers so I’m assuming it was there. Or maybe the fans were steering/tilting.  I know it had a slender shape to it. Slender like a jet shape. It was NOT a model aircraft though.

ht9shd,I love you Tulsa," TL/DR  --> Klandemic to Pandemic, educate and re-imagine.

I’m gonna start my story in current day Tulsa, since we are the center of the universe. Well,  center of the revolution rather.  Keep in mind the recent SCOTUS ruling and the recent BLM protests and the Trump rallies, I mean how could you forget that anyway.  Anyway, one of my imaginary intolerably angry Indian personalities peaked my interest in a piece of marble I see all the time, but have never noticed.  Almost as if it was invisible.  I’m gonna start there at the [Tulsa Association of Pioneers Monument](https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=111535), or as the kids call it, The Back to Back Genocide Champions Trophy.  I felt my investigatory work was pretty excellent when I found Bynum's name just a few apart from Brady.  Someone far more observant and informed than I pointed out to me the monument celebrates a bbq on September 21, 1921.  Dang, I thought, that’s pretty god damn quick, from blood to bbq sauce.  I wonder what this bbq was like?  

When you go back into the Tulsa World collection and look up this event, you’ll find it didn’t happen on September 21, it was actually on the front page of the [September 18](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc77855/m1/1/zoom/?q=%22sam%20kennedy%22&resolution=4&lat=4063.4336267831563&lon=1704.192864474905) Sunday morning paper.  So, the BBQ was on September 17th, a [Saturday](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc77854/m1/1/zoom/?q=september%2017,%201921&resolution=3&lat=4796.89047357352&lon=2181.9051179187013).  The day before that, the Tulsa County Fair started in town.  It was especially huge and for the first time, it was free.  It ran from the 16th - 20th.  The KKK makes front page news the two days leading into the fair,  [Thursday](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc77852/?q=september%2015%2C%201921) and [Friday](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc77853/m1/1/zoom/?q=september%2016,%201921&resolution=4&lat=4673.792286118708&lon=2385.2408011413745).  They basically say, this is our town, and if your lawless ass comes around it aint gonna be good. What else comes to town during this time?  [Monday’s paper](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc77856/m1/1/zoom/?resolution=6&lat=2400.032597430193&lon=1290.964614810584) tells us the Confederate Reunion will be here for a three day event! Yay! What a good time to have them, we’ll be having a huge free fair, how convenient.  Let's make the train rides into Tulsa free too, if you wear your red nose.  Oh wait, it's already free for grey coats, ok good.  Wouldn’t want to limit the influx of our recruiting opportunities.  KKK heavily recruited within the confederate reunions, and with good reason as they both treat non whites worse than livestock. 

Just in case we gotta stop and talk about what the Civil War was about, it was definitely about [slavery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwvX5IosZs).  It’s not that it [wasn’t about states rights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7y3pJCufFU), it was just specifically about the [states rights to own people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5b_-TZwQ0I).  But if you tell the story a certain way long enough, the [southern lost cause becomes history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y6luq3aUvc).  Ok, anyway, enough of the civil war, we all know the good guys won that right?  I dunno really.  I think the south won.  They killed the President one week after the “end” of the civil war, and replacing Lincoln, was his Democrat VP, the uneducated Andrew Johnson.  He immediately put into legislation the planned oppression of blacks while welcoming the seceded states back to the union.  He’ll go down as one of the worst presidents in history.  Now, Democrats then were white power people, that was their basic platform.  Watch this [Vox video on Wilmington NC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVQomlXMeek) to see all the parallels in their story and Tulsa’s 1921 Massacre.  Another interracial love story that ends with a mob of angry white people burning down black property and then burying the history.  So we see, slavery had been abolished, so they made legal slavery; the real pride of the south. 

I want to get back to the BBQ / County Fair / Statewide Confederate Reunion in 1921, but to do that event any justice we’d first have to describe the biggo National Confederate Reunion in Tulsa three years prior in 1918.  It should be noted that all five civilized tribes supported the confederacy.  Oklahoma is a southern state in that respect.  Tulsa rolled out the red carpet for these red noses in grey suits.  The [collectors edition Tulsa World](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc135846/m1/1/zoom/?q=%22confederate%20reunion%22&resolution=4&lat=4729.903212136719&lon=2353.5883789062527) is a showcase all of its own.  Woodrow Wilson is the man of the hour as he’s the first southern president since the Civil War.  Interestingly, he was our president during WW1.  Nearly every company in Tulsa takes out full page, half page, quarter page ads in the paper. They boast about how awesome our schools are.  They pretty much make a[ Tulsa for Tesla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtqft4Excns) video but way better.  The Majestic Theatre is showing movies at never before seen low prices.  Well, they're showing one movie, [The Birth of a Nation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebtiJH3EOHo), and it runs for 12 hours a day, all weekend.  That's a three hour klan movie, on repeat, four times in a row, three days in a row for cheaper than you've ever seen a movie.  Name any other fucking thing people have ever done that with. 

In that newspaper, specifically, they tell a story about the “birth of our city,” if you will. [From Little Acorns Big Oaks Grow](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc135846/m1/19/zoom/?resolution=4&lat=1397.4210424364974&lon=1812.2887550026617). Read the story.  These dudes are glorified as the fathers of our city, in a special edition of a paper that is glorifying the birth of a nation, as if the city isn't older than time.  They say in that paper, that yeah we know Tulsa has blown up in the past twenty years since its incorporation, but what will happen in the next five years will greatly overshadow everything that's been done.  Tulsa continues to blow the fuck up between the two confederate reunions in 1918 and 1921, it also burns down, a certain part of it at least.  

The oil game was crushing it, especially with the war time needs for oil, followed by the industrial explosion after WW1.  Think about all the cars they made after the economy switched from wartime to peacetime production.  Entire industries were birthed.  Catalog purchasing became popular in this time.  People were told to buy. And boy did they get everyone onto buying cars. So many cars in fact, Route 66 was born shortly later.  They were booming, the oil business was[ pretty pretty pretty good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_05qJTeNNI).  They even gave away cars at the national reunion to several lucky racists.  

Back to the statewide confederate reunion in 1921… After the week long county fair party and confederate business meetings, the fellas end with a good old fashioned Southern Ball at the convention center, where the dude in the paper says how great of a city it is, so great in fact that the bootblacks shined their shoes for free on their way to the convention center.  This is the same city that looted and burned down a square mile of “Little Africa” three months prior, over a bootblack on an elevator with a white girl.  That’s what happened on September 21, 1921, not a fuckin kumbaya bbq at papa Kennedys farm with the fathers of the city, rather a Southern Ball that celebrated and danced in the very building that imprisoned hundreds of blacks just three months prior.

The next day, the[ idiots had their parade](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc77859/m1/1/zoom/?q=september%201921%20tulsa&resolution=3&lat=4416.034060120648&lon=2379.470703125), but they used cars because the old timers were just too old.  Dude even fell down some stairs and broke himself, it's in the paper.  At the end of this spiritual journey, Tate Brady gave a shout out to how good of a job Tulsa did again as the host of RocklaHatredfest.  He then calls for all camps to create committees whose sole purpose is to find false histories, those that de-glorified the south, and destroy them.  No more fake news.  He called upon them to collaborate with their women and libraries and historical societies and school curriculums and to use all means possible to white wash history as it should be told.  And I’m sure, to etch into stone, whenever possible, the glories of the south.  I want to note that the governor, the national guardsman, the mayor, the police chief, the sheriff, and police officers were in attendance at this glorious reunion. And why wouldn't they be there? Police were per capita the highest occupation in the klan.  

Why is the date wrong on the monument? Everyone knows if you're in the wedding party you gotta get there a couple days early.  The whole event was one big old-timers day, from the OG’s only bbq, to friends and family weekend at the fair, to professional business meetings at the reunion, to the big ball for men without any.  That and JM Hall was probably a fuckin idiot, thats why he wanted his name on the marble phallus three times.  

In ‘47, the Tulsa Associations of Pioneers gave land to the city, about an acre worth, as long as the city would allow the erection of their rock hard phallus.  The city warmly accepted.  Then a few months later, the Tulsa Association of Pioneers came back to the city and was like, hey we’ll give you four more acres, it will connect Owen Park to the land the statue is on, as long as you let us have our annual bbq there every year, it's called “Old-Timers Day.”  City again graciously accepted.  The organization disband in 1964, poetically, the year of the Civil Rights Act.  

For one, I’m not sure that monument stands on the land it was supposed to be put on, but secondly, and more importantly, mother fuck old-timers day.  Fuck that with a fuckin dogs dick.  If anyone deserves a city sanctioned annual party in our public park it's the people of Tulsa who can accept the ugly truths about our history and realize how they uniquely shape who we are, and what our natural perspectives are, and by doing so begin to exercise the empathy necessary to find comfort and celebration in each other's existence together.  

Now, back to present day, we got a president who comes to our city (rez) on Juneteenth, defending the confederate flag and monuments?  We got a president who shows up on the stolen land at Mt Rushmore on 4th of July? We got a mayor who gives not one shit about doing a good job as mayor during the pandemic?  Do the Governor and Mayor only care about the continuation of their political campaign? Why? Because the supremacy ideology is still around. They care not about people, but only care to preserve their power, and thus perpetuate their version of history. They built the system we know as America, now we have this goofy dog shit happening.  Behold, the greatest country in the world.  

Work with me here, but maybe this illusion isn’t worth returning to.  This virus is the perfect “time out.”  It's up to everyone to perpetuate the truth in history.  They want us to be divided.  They need that turmoil and class division, that fear and hatred and misunderstanding.  They also need us to grease the gears of the grand illusion.  Our time is their money.  Fuck all that shit man, life is for more than that.

hzlen8,"COVID Update - July 28, 2020: We need to remember . . ."," When this pandemic is over, we need to remember who helped spread knowledge and scientific information, and who spread misinformation, lies, and propaganda.

We need to remember people like Elon Musk, who embraced the two doctors from Bakersfield who promoted their video claiming COVID-19 was no big deal. We shouldn’t forget how he joined forces with right winger [James O’Keefe](https://www.businessinsider.com/james-okeefe-project-veritas-sting-fails-2017-11) in spreading lies about COVID. Want to buy a Tesla? Remember [how they fired workers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/01/tesla-plant-firings/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter) for staying home during COVID, even though they said it was OK.

Let’s not forget this guy, Sean Feucht, who failed in his bid for Republican U.S. Representative for CA District 3. On Sunday, he brought together 1,200 people on Cardiff Beach, packed together, with no masks. His next stop is a similar extravaganza in August in Los Angeles.

And let’s not forget President Trump and his family, who are busy tweeting lies and misinformation about COVID-19 to their millions of followers. All the silly mainstream media commentators who thought Trump was getting “more presidential” had to eat their words for the 1,000th time as he once again promoted hydroxychloroquine as a miracle cure and promoted a video from some “doctors” that Facebook and Twitter had to remove.

Remember Pastor John MacArthur of Grace Community Church, who claims that his church has a “duty to remain open.” Instead of being a leader in mobilizing the church to combat the pandemic, he is turning his sermons into potential superspreader events.

People like this are one of the main reasons our country is pitied throughout the world. People like this are why I can’t hug my grandkids, why “essential” retail workers have to endure abuse from anti-maskers, why more than 100,000 people have died who shouldn’t have died. They did their part in creating this situation:

The seven day moving average fatality rate has now climbed over 1,000. The total toll just went over 150,000. Our case fatality rate has dropped to 4.1%, from 5.8% a month ago. Let’s say it drops another 1.7% over the next month, giving us a CFR on August 25 of 2.4%. And let’s say the daily case count doesn’t keep growing, but plateaus around 75,000 cases a day. You do the math:

75,000 x 2.4% = 1,800 deaths a day.

That’s not a prediction; it’s just what the upper limit might be if we don’t start to take this pandemic seriously. I really worry about our direction in states that have decided to open their schools up to in-person schooling no matter how bad their case growth.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8v2ipza5ind51.jpg?width=833&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=38f152711d21f66117462d5a76806df0149fc1a5

California’s Zorgi Score of 13.1 isn’t great, but it’s way better than the other states. Consider Nevada:

* Cumulative cases up 168%, from 16,000 to 44,000
* Case doubling days have dropped from 31 days to 23
* Daily case count increased by 109%, from 500 to 1,000+
* Fatalities up 48%, from 500 to 739
* Daily fatalities up over 900%, from 1 a day to 13
* Test positivity rate of 14.5%
* Tests per case dropped from 16 to 10

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f84bicd7ind51.jpg?width=819&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=827a84e06afe97b8e2050dad01702c1825490135

The saving grace in San Diego county has been the low positivity rate. Even though daily testing has leveled off, the rate is hovering at just over 5%. The daily case count at 472 is about 100 more than it was a month ago.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ub8duk49ind51.jpg?width=845&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=596d6957ba8cde6acb7e5e0e20ead0080644c4e2

In LA County, we’re seeing a slight, but very welcome decrease in daily cases, from around 3,300 a day two weeks ago to 2,600 a day now. The only bad thing is that the positivity rate is too high, even with a decrease in testing. It needs to get a lot closer to 5%.

That said, when there’s a shortage of testing supplies, that alone may drive up the positivity rate artificially. Why? because tests start getting “triaged” again, reserved for only those showing symptoms. Naturally, a positivity rate derived from symptomatic people will be much higher than one from random samples of the population.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/njae4gxaind51.jpg?width=824&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3464c9e91ed116847b1f15aa79ed10a8c82834d2

Hopefully, the daily fatality count in San Diego is starting to decline. We’ll need a few more days to see if this direction holds. Note the CFR of only 1.4%, compared to the U.S. CFR of 4.1%. That makes a huge difference in the number of fatalities.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gi3btrncind51.jpg?width=861&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=acb494de61eee9c5e2339bde1a2b7fb7f79d5bfb

LA County has two good trends going on with fatalities: a steady drop in the daily fatality count as well as a drop in the CFR. The fatality doubling days appear to be leveling off at around 60 days, but hopefully that’s just temporary.

Sean Feucht held his rally on the beach practically in my back yard. Fortunately, he picked an area that’s been looking better than it was a month ago.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xzd4evneind51.jpg?width=818&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9135d03b8bdad8ab00e93bce46fcd1198e11721c

Still, as CY4 shows, cases have increased over 200% in Carlsbad and over 150% in Encinitas. I remember two or three months ago wondering if we’d ever have more than 33 cases in Encinitas. During the nationwide lockdown, we stayed there for about 3 weeks.

COVID used to be an abstraction in Carlsbad and Encinitas, with a prevalence index of 852 and 638 respectively. Now it’s 268 for Carlsbad and 254 for Encinitas. That means that the average statistical person in those cities doesn’t know anyone personally who’s had experience with COVID, but that could change very soon.

Fortunately, case doubling days in both cities are out of the danger zone – 33 days for Carlsbad and 52 for Encinitas.

Let’s hope that when Mr. Feucht gathers his followers in Los Angeles next month he stays out of communities where the virus is out of control. They already have enough problems to deal with.

Finally, a word about my supposedly one-sided presentation of gatherings of people, inside and outside. Several people have called me biased, a liar, etc., etc.

Let me note the following:

1. We don’t have **any** evidence that BLM protests contributed in a significant way to the spikes that occurred across the U.S. We do have lots of pictures of them, and anyone who claims that the level of mask-wearing at the gathering in Cardiff on Sunday was the same as that of the BLM protests is gaslighting us. That’s like Trump claiming he had a bigger inauguration rally than Obama. Yes, of course there were people at BLM protests who didn’t wear masks, but there were many, many more who did.
2. We do have proof that superspreader events have occurred at inside religious gatherings, inside bars, inside restaurants, and inside gyms. These are not “anecdotes.” These are from reports from case trackers in LA County and San Diego County.
3. We do know that COVID is not spread simply by people being close to each other. It’s spread through droplets, many of them so small that they are classified as aerosols by experts. And we do know that masks, even home made ones, stop a lot of those droplets from going anywhere. Just as in real estate the saying is “location, location, location,” for infections, the saying is “dosage, dosage, dosage”. Masks don’t eliminate coronavirus, but they do substantially reduce the dosage.
4. We do know that transmitting the virus to others is far less likely outside, and even less likely when people are moving. If you haven’t looked at the video from Prof. Kimberly Prather, please do so before you argue otherwise.
5. This all means that in terms of ranking risks for gatherings of people, the following is true: **Very risky**: inside gatherings for more than a few minutes where people are singing or chanting. **Risky**: outside gatherings where people are not moving and not wearing masks and are together for more than 15 minutes. **Less risky**: outside gatherings where people are constantly moving and most are wearing masks.
6. The idea that somehow we should evaluate everything in society from the point of view of zero risk is nonsense. By the way, that was never the point of the national lockdown either. You don’t eliminate the virus by eliminating all risk. You eliminate it by managing risk, and estimating it based on the best available science.

Having said all that, I expect to get flooded again with all sorts of messages telling me I’m a hypocrite and a liar and I should just shut up. I know, you want me to claim that the BLM protests were dangerous; you want me to condemn them; you want me to criticize all gatherings equally.

The problem is, you haven’t presented me with any data that shows they should be treated equally. But I have presented you with evidence that there are in fact differences.

I can’t help but wonder if there’s another agenda involved.

By the way, I’m not going to answer these posts with the same argument over and over again. I think I’ve addressed this many times, and I really don’t have anything more to add to the discussion.

I’m willing to buy the materials myself if I can find an electrician to install it. I’ve seen online that I should expect to pay $300-$400 labor and materials, but these estimates I’m getting are closer to $1000, and I’m afraid it’s because there’s a shiny car in the driveway.

*~12:02 start, ~12:50 end*

Major talking points he made: 

&nbsp;

**General**

&nbsp;

Wear a mask, Physically distance, Wash your hands, & Minimize mixing. 

Extraordinary weather conditions that many Californians are suffering through. Weather has included thousands of dry lightning strikes, causing fires. Wind gusts of up to 70 mph in Santa Ana. Hottest temps seen in 70 years. Death Valley may have recorded hottest temperature in modern recording history (~130F yesterday). Making a 5 degree change in your AC unit can save up to 20% of energy costs.

Thanks the citizens of CA for their efforts in reducing transmission of COVID-19. We are trending in the right direction but we must aim to be below 5% positivity rate.
_________
**Active Wildfires through the State:**

&nbsp;

15 Active Fires burning: enormous heat index affects both citizens & our firefighters.

-River Fire: 10% contained (FMAG: federal entity helping with ability to distribute emergency resources)

-Ranch Fire: 19% contained

-Lake Fire: 31% contained

-Apple Fire: 95% contained (FMAG)

____________
**Actions CA is Taking to Conserve Energy:**

&nbsp;

The pressure of the heat/weather has caused temporary service interruptions for some customers that will continue for the next few days.

&nbsp;

Expecting more strain on system particularly today: ~4400 Megawatts short of where we need to be. Addressing through different methods of procurement. You can't control the weather but you can prepare for the events. We failed to predict and plan these shortages. Simply unacceptable; Newsom takes responsibility for the shortcomings. Working to reduce energy use.

&nbsp;

Emergency proclamation to shift energy consumption:

1) Large energy users to shift to back-up power during peak hours (~3pm-10pm). Winds have been mild which is good for fires but bad for wind energy.

2) Utilities to power stored for PSPS. New protocols for PG&E & other independent suppliers of energy

3) Working with ports & ships to reduce consumption from the grid while at port. West coast ports utilize a tremendous amount of energy. 

&nbsp;

Working with major consumers to reduce usage (Nestle, Tesla, etc.). Working to get support from state water board, peaker plants & getting them online. Even with all the measures, we are *likely to fall short* of the demand for next 72 hours. Investigations into what happened & implications for future between CALISO (focuses on what materials are needed to meet forecast of energy needs) & CA Energy Commission (does forecast for energy needs) & PUC. 

Committed to working towards a more green future. It is both an economic imperative and a ethical imperative. In transition phase, there needs to be more insurance. Need to be able to recognize gaps in reliability in delivering high quality, low cost energy to citizens. 
_________
_________
**Positivity Rate** (**[Today's COVID-19 Statistics](https://update.covid19.ca.gov/)**): 

A metric to show changes in the rates of infection. Graphs pictured show the number of positive cases in the tests conducted. An increase in the rate indicates an increase in spread of the virus.

&nbsp;

Backlogged cases: before backlog were added, 7.5% on 7/25, 7.0% on 8/1. Now 7.6% & 7.2%. Trends are still down.

24 hr: 6,469. ~137k tests/day.

7 day average: 9,446

7 day: **___%**, **down** from ___% 1 week ago

14 day: **6.5%**,  **down** from ___% 2 weeks ago

Conclusion: trend is down. [editor's note: typical slides for positivity rate & hospital capacity were not shown. Some data missing]

&nbsp;


**Hospital Capacity** 

Non-ICU Beds: 4,975, ~21% decrease over 14 days. ~7% of admitted COVID+

ICU: 1,589. ~21% decrease over 14 days. ~19% of admitted COVID+. ___ total ICU beds available. ___ total ICU bed surge capacity. ___ ventilators available.

&nbsp;

**Deaths**

&nbsp;

132/day. Disease is deadly. Please take this seriously. Stories of loved ones having to die alone without saying goodbye to their family & friends.
________
________

**QUESTIONS**

&nbsp;

Q1: head of ISL pointed fingers at PUC for energy shortfall. address?

A1: emergency proclamation addresses this specifically. looking to mitigate exports, scour more imports, look @ backup generators for PSPS protocols. Investigation team will report findings to public ASAP.

&nbsp;

Q2: not enough warning to prepare. what can you tell people now that it can happen at any time?

A2: FlexAlert to be used to inform citizens. People should have been told sooner. Investigation will help list ways to mitigate future outages. IOU (investor owned utilities) have protocols & procedures with PUC on PSPS. Notification protocols to address size & duration of energy & fire impacts. 

&nbsp;

Q3: in re: paid family leave. Stuck in assembly. Any chance it will pass in next 2 weeks? address?

A3: working hard to make sure it passes. part of broader commitment with legislature. has confidence it will be passed by end of legislative calendar.

&nbsp;

Q4: outages in re: distance learning. Instructional minutes given a waiver & affected students given excused absences?

A4: we have to be flexible & ideological. This is very temporary. The magnitude of the weather event & heat dome in Western coast not expected to persist into Wednesday. Outages likely to affect peak hours, not instructional hours. Open to making adjustments based on impact to distance learning.

&nbsp;

Q5: head of ISO said they warned public utilities commission about power shortage possibility years ago. were you aware? address?

A5: exact reason why we are doing investigation to ensure transparency & shared responsibility. mindful of dynamics of energy policy. spent a major portion of last year addressing PG&E bankruptcy. Looking to provide more reliable, cheaper energy for citizens of CA. Must remain committed to an accountable approach in transitioning to a more green energy future.

&nbsp;

Q6: you said you didn't know problems with CALReady system. is there communication problem with admin? 

A6: governing a state as large as ours makes it difficult to predict the day-to-day. Newsom admits he has responsibility and fault. Will fix ASAP.

&nbsp;

Q7: do you support grid regionalizations? address? labor union has been against the proposal for a while.

A7: concerns about transparency & labor unions. been in active conversations for the last few years. collective decision between administration, legislators, unions that it was best to wait until process of getting PG&E out of bankruptcy is completed.

&nbsp;

Q8: you are addressing the entire country this week as a representative of CA. address?

A8: no direct speech. engaged conversations with members of Congress & Senate. looks forward to educating public about Kamala Harris & Joe Biden. Looking forward to ""turning the page"" of the status quo and working towards a better future.

&nbsp;

Q9: Why delays in removing SD county from watchlist? State hasn't released new guidance for re-opening for businesses.

A9: July 13th guidance explained that re-opening cannot occur until public health issues new guidelines. SD expected to be removed from watchlist tomorrow. We must be flexible to address the virus & re-opening. 
_________
________

**List of counties on watchlist for at least 3 days: 42**

(Old: 37) Alameda, Butte, Colusa, Contra Costa, Fresno, *Glenn*, Imperial, Kern, Kings, LA, Madera, Marin, Merced, Mono, Monterey, Napa, Orange, Placer, Riverside, Sacramento, San Benito, San Bernandino, San Diego, San Francisco, San Joaquin, San Mateo, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Solano, Sonoma, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tulare, Ventura, Yolo, Yuba

(New: 5) Amador, Calaveras, Inyo, Mendocino, Sierra

(Removed: 1) Santa Cruz (San Diego expected to be removed from list tomorrow)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**When do counties get placed on the watchlist??**

Counties are put on the watchlist when their data exceeds the following:

1) Case rate (per 100,000) >100... OR Case rate (per 100,000) >25 AND testing positivity >8.0%

2) >10% increase in the average number of confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized

3) <20% of staffed ICU beds are available... OR <25% of ventilators are available

*Getting off of the list* would require the county to fare better than those limits. Counties are on the list when one or more metrics are met. Counties are removed from the list when all three are cleared.

ietw6s,Megathread: TS/Hurricanes Marco and Laura (AKA: The M'Larco Situation),"#What is Damp May Never Dry!
**Post Last Updated: 8/25/2020 @ 7:30pm**

Jim Cantore is (probably) coming to town and his guest list includes two names: Marco and Laura. Ugh, 2020. 

In all seriousness, this is an unprecedented event and there are a lot of questions, comments and speculation out there right now and posts are flying into the new queue. **In order to make it easier and provide current information to individuals, please keep the conversations surrounding the two systems (Marco and Laura) to this thread.**  We are trying to consolidate the more serious conversations/information to this thread. **It is highly recommend that you sort comments by new given the changing environment** 

For the time being, memes and funny-ish posts can be standalone posts. This is subject to change depending on how the situation evolves. Despite all the humor surrounding it, please take this event seriously and make plans based upon your needs.

Below is some general information/advice, but should not be taken as official recommendations. **Please listen to local/national authorities in determining your next course of actions.** I will try to update this post with current information when I can. 

P.S. If you believe something should be appended/amended to this post, please let me know and I'll be happy to consider it.

#What is happening? 

Little Marco couldn't make it to Louisiana and decided to chill out in Pensacola.

As of 7:30pm on 8/25/2020 - Laura is heading to the TX/LA border. Stay safe folks! 

#Where can I get more information on projected paths, evacuation notices, and general preparation information?

#Should I evacuate?

Please refer to the above local/national section when making your evacuation plans. Every person's situation is different. Please begin making preparations 3-4 days out. [I recommend checking this page from Fox 8 for up to date information](https://www.fox8live.com/2020/08/22/parish-by-parish-voluntary-mandatory-evacuations-due-marco-laura/) (I'm trying to monitor it best I can). 

**Mandatory Evacuations (As of 8/23):**

* [Mandatory evacuations have been issued for the eastbank of Plaquemines Parish and the westbank, from the Phillips 66 refinery to Venice. A mandatory evacuation has also been issued for Lafourche Parish, south of the Leon Theriot flood gate.

#Cat 3 then flee, otherwise I'm staying.

Cool. Good For You! Some people aren't so lucky and can't afford to stay. However, here's some general advice for those of us who are new to those whole hurricane thing:

* **Expect your power to go out.** Entergy NOLA is a regulated monopoly and it's hot garbage. You should anticipate your power going out for up to a month in the middle of August. 
* **Expect it to flood.** If you're expecting the SWBNO to do their job, I have a bridge to sell you. Move your cars to the neutral ground or a high spot. 
* **Wear your damn masks.** THIS IS A 2020 COMBO SPECIAL!
* **Fill up your gas tanks.** Or charge your electric car. Doesn't matter, just make sure you can leave if you need to. 
* **Stock up on your essentials.** Do this now. Do not wait.
* **Get you and your pets medicines.** This is often overlooked. If you have essential medical needs, get your refills now (this includes the good bois and cool cats and kittens).
* **Fill up your bathtub the night before.** Boil advisories are expected and you will need water to flush the toilets. 
* **Put bottled water in the freezer.** Trust me on this one, fill your freezer to the MAX with water bottles. It will keep your freezer colder for longer and you'll have cool water during an extended power outage. Also, keep your fridge and freezer closed for as long as you can.
* **Charge your spare batteries.** If you have external rechargeable batteries for your phones, charge them up now. This includes laptops as well - you can charge your phone with a laptop! 
* **Turn around, don't drown.** Do not be a dumbass and drive through high water. I don't care if your Tesla can float or if your F150 is lifted for her pleasure. Don't drive through high water.

#What should I buy?

[/r/TropicalWeather has a fantastic mega-thread on this that I am stealing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/bvdivw/2019_hurricane_supplies_megathread/) I highly recommend visiting this link and making sure that you have all of these things in your household.

Also pop-tarts. All the pop-tarts. Brown sugar for life though.  

#How much alcohol should I stock up on?

Yes. 

#What about public transportation? Will it still be operational?

While a lot of people don't have reliable alternative transportation, always make sure you have a plan. In general, you shouldn't expect public transport to operate during a hurricane. Don't rely upon it. Make plans to move to a safe location or a shelter/evacuation center *prior to the storm.* 

Update as of 8/23 from RTA: 

> In preparation for impacts from Marco & Laura the RTA will suspend streetcar service at 4 p.m. on Sunday, Aug 23. Bus service will be provided on streetcar routes until approx. 2 am on Monday, Aug 24. For info on impacts, visit http://RTAforward.org or call 504-248-3900.

#Sandbags?

If they become available, NOLA.com has a running list of locations that currently are distributing sandbags. [You can find the list here](https://www.nola.com/news/hurricane/article_6ed28da0-e3ca-11ea-b0e0-3b8b7f41b1a5.html). 

#Can you sharpie this situation away?

Neither NOAA nor FEMA recommends this. It doesn't work.

======================================================================== 

Smoke a bowl, turn on some music and join me....

As my reality quickly shifted in March forcing me to become an eccentric hobbit, I had to totally bail on my [Rocky Mountain powder chasing fantasies](https://wolfcreekski.com/) and learn to [cope](https://i.redd.it/hcizep26sq141.jpg).  I fed my outdoor addiction by taking extra long dog walks, mostly to my new favorite park in Tulsa, the beautiful [mayhem](https://i.redd.it/4puxxm9wq9841.jpg) that is Owen Park.  I went there specifically to check out an old monument I had heard about online, the [Tulsa Association of Pioneers Monument](https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=111535), or as the kids call it, the [Back to Back Genocide Champions Trophy Monumen](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/hke29d/back_to_back_genocide_champions_trophy_or_just/)t, the[ B2BGCTM](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/ighqlc/what_is_b2bgctm_or_what_does_it_stand_for/).  I think this is one of the most interesting things in Tulsa, personally.  It’s like a poetic mystery but painfully obvious at the same time.  No one knows anything about it that I’ve ever talked to, and no one really wants to talk about it.  It’s a classic [Tulsa public secret](https://www.centerforpublicsecrets.org/).    

Some would say, if there’s one thing Oklahoma does well [it’s barbecue](https://www.travelok.com/article_page/bring-on-the-bbq-at-oklahomas-barbecue-events).  That may be true, we do a mean que, but I’ve been to hundreds, and no barbecue I’ve ever been to, or ever heard of, besides this event, has ever been epic enough to call for [a monument to be made in recognition of its attendees' greatness](https://www.hmdb.org/PhotoFullSize.asp?PhotoID=408583).  The monument’s poetic timeline, from 1921-1964, coincides perfectly with the biggest act of racial violence in the US since the civil war, and the biggest piece of civil rights legislation ever signed.  The date engraved into the marble monument, September 21, 1921, doesn't even match [the newspaper article that talks about a similar barbecue](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc77855/m1/1/zoom/?q=%22sam%20kennedy%22&resolution=1&lat=4548.271944654251&lon=1725.0457087131865), so that adds a layer of interest.  Maybe there were two BBQ’s, maybe the marble slab typewriter typo’d the engraving on the surely mega expensive rock, or maybe the entire newspaper is incorrect.  Additionally, this is[ not where the monument originally sat, nor are all the pieces currently displayed even original](https://www.hmdb.org/PhotoFullSize.asp?PhotoID=408582).  It’s location adds an extra layer of fucketry, when you find out that the [Indian Memorial in close proximity celebrating the three tribes borders](https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=111583), was there for fifteen years before the [B2BGCTM](https://i.redd.it/sq0db1dj93j51.png) was erected close by.  Now that's a biggo fuck you if you ask me.  Hold on, I’m trying to walk and type this on my phone but my [idiot dog stopped and smelled something he had to pee on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuKofYgAk78)…  

In a time where I saw the local concert hall change its name from Brady Theater, the name Peter Mayo gave it,[ back to its original name](https://tulsaworld.com/news/local/brady-theater-making-progress-toward-changing-its-name/article_8d009b12-5d4f-5b64-b5b1-e619a4f9c7eb.html), The Tulsa Theatre, and a time where I saw[ Tate Brady’s star removed from out front of the Cain’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/hf41ei/bye_bye/), I began to become[ more curious about our city’s past](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Qru7d5qBpU).  Hell, [Oklahoma history in general](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Oklahoma-Swindle-Religion-Americas/dp/1496209982), all of a sudden became overwhelmingly interesting.  Especially now that we’re in [Tulsa, MCN](http://www.batesline.com/archives/2020/07/mcgirt-v-oklahoma-scotus-tulsa.html).  So anyway, I took a walk to Owen Park and when I got there I was underwhelmed to say the least.  A discolored marble monument with an engraving talking about a barbecue sat just out front of the Fire Station, between the Indian Memorial and a [Children's Museum](https://discoverylab.org/), and close by what is said to be “[The Oldest House in Tulsa.](https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=111532)”  The park is sprawling with mature trees everywhere, a sweet little walking bridge,  a random set of old concrete steps once used for getting into carriages, a really cool, and what I’m sure is under-used, mini amphitheatre.  The [pond was murky with excessive trash collecting where the drainage meets the water](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/i13ile/diving_at_owen_parks_pond_today_in_1921/).  My[ fishing club](http://www.tu420.com/) would be sad, but I saw fish in there as I walked the banks, so there’s that.  There *are* fish in that pond, don’t let anyone tell you there’s not, especially not the people representing the neighborhood on a city committee.  Those people may just not know anything.  After making my rounds and seeing the haggard horseshoe pit and imaginary volleyball courts, I made my way back to the monuments at the entrance.  [The sun was hitting it just right](https://i.redd.it/nj2g4png1oh51.jpg), it totally looked like a dick.  Sweet.  

I walked up, read the engraving, 

========

This stone marks the ground where ""Old Timers""

who had lived in Tulsa and vicinity over

thirty years, met on Sept. 21, 1921,

at a Barbecue given by

Dr. Sam G. Kennedy and Dr. Jim Kennedy.

They all visited with old friends,

reminisced and organized the

""Tulsa Association of Pioneers""

to Commemorate and Perpetuate

the memory of those

""Sturdy Pioneers"" who, by their

sacrafice and effort

helped to build a great Empire.

======

After finding [Bynum](https://tulsaworld.com/news/local/tulsa-mayor-g-t-bynum-wins-reelection-gets-second-term/article_8f6c9752-9b87-5b91-85af-b442f64c5a50.html)’s and[ Brady’s name on the monument](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/hfsihc/found_in_interesting_the_names_brady_and_bynum/), someone pointed out the date, September 21, 1921.  Wow, I thought, three and a half months after the most violent act of racial violence since the civil war and these people decided to have a barbeque to celebrate their championing of the city.  Interesting.  Why are there parentheses around “Sturdy Pioneer” and “Old Timers”?  Who are these Kennedy people?  Can JM Hall spell sacrifice or does *sacrafice* mean something totally different?  He can’t spell and he got the date wrong? Jesus.  What “great Empire” did they manage to build?  

I went back to [read about the time between the massacre and the barbecue](https://gateway.okhistory.org/search/?q=august+10%2C+1921&t=fulltext&sort=).  My heads are familiar with the [days between](https://www.dead.net/features/greatest-stories-ever-told/greatest-stories-ever-told-days-between), this is similar, but from blood to barbecue sauce.  You can follow along if you want, break on thru to the other side with us as we turn [the upside down](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tvlse/) inside out.  

Before I mentally moved entirely back to 1921, and just read the daily paper like its red hot news fresh off the press everyday, I started with[ September 21, 1921](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc77858/m1/1/zoom/?q=september%201921%20tulsa&resolution=8&lat=3365.0951478710595&lon=3511.5333209335217) and checked out the Tulsa Daily World from that date.  What I found was not a BBQ.  What actually happened on September 21, 1921 was a [state wide confederate reunion southern ball at Convention Hall](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc77858/m1/1/zoom/?q=september%201921%20tulsa&resolution=1&lat=2940.3716942042774&lon=4018.4702251546682), the building we now know as The Tulsa Theatre.  Interesting. Confederate Reunion, I thought, that sounds like a nightmare.  Turns out the State Wide Confederate Reunion of 1921 wasn’t the first confederate reunion hosted by Tulsa.  

Just in case we gotta stop and talk about what the Civil War was about, it was definitely about [slavery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwvX5IosZs).  It’s not that it [wasn’t about states rights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7y3pJCufFU), it was just specifically about the [states rights to own people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5b_-TZwQ0I).  But if you tell the story a certain way long enough, the [southern lost cause becomes history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y6luq3aUvc).  So, we can move on...

In 1914, some [5000 confederate veterans camped out in Owen Park](https://www.itthc.com/cgi-bin/bbs62x/webbbs_config.pl?md=read;id=883), but that was nothing compared to the National Confederate Reunion of 1918.  Just look at [this collectors edition Tulsa World](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc135846/m1/1/zoom/?q=%22confederate%20reunion%22&resolution=10.981813287774065&lat=3502.3051701838626&lon=4508.511752802601).  A quick who’s who for the heroes on the cover… top left is President of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis.  Tate Brady presided over the 1921 reunion with a custom gavel made from a tree from Davis’ estate in Biloxi, MS “[The Beauvoir](https://www.visitbeauvoir.org/).”  Story is, Davis would sit under that tree as he wrote the “south’s greatest book,” *The Rise and Fall of the Confederacy*.  I’ve been to the Beauvoir, thanks Gramma and Grampa.  Katrina killed that tree I’m sure, but maybe not.  Top Right is General Robert E Lee, you recognize his name from the oh wait, it’s Council Oak Elementary now(Lt Gov Matt Pinnell’s School).  “Black” Jack Pershing, not what he was actually called but I'm gonna church it up.  People thought this man was so fucking good at being an American they made him his own rank in the military.  I’m not joking, and they’ve never done that for anyone else.  Nathan Bedford Forrest, bottom left, he ran the klan for a while but poetically is the namesake for Forrest Gump, to remind us that “[sometimes things don’t make no sense.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raVFzZZLp3A)”  Man of the Hour, Woodrow Wilson(Lt Gov Matt Pinnell’s School), front and center, Klansman loved him.  For instance, proud klansman Charley Guthrie named his son after the bastard, we know him as [Woody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-FHJ5z3e3o).  President Wilson was communicated with directly from this reunion, and offered full support of the war from the grey coats.  Of course we support it right?  We’re a confederate oil production town in a war time economy.  Honestly, look at that cover, you just gotta love the Gump / Guthrie irony right now.  

Anyway, look through this paper, see how the city rolls out the red red carpet for these people.  They pretty much make a[ Tulsa for Tesla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtqft4Excns) video but way better.  The [Southern Memorial Association](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc135846/m1/35/zoom/?q=daughters&resolution=1&lat=3744.941883404389&lon=1141.1678439852508) is here, check out their goals, which sound super familiar, especially the marble monument part.  Businesses take out full page ads, half page ads, train rides are free into the city, there’s a fair, there’s a parade, movies are cheaper than they’ve ever been.  Well, [Majestic Theatre is only showing one movie, *The Birth of a Nation*, and it plays everyday for four days straight, 12 hours a day](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc135846/m1/35/zoom/?q=daughters&resolution=4&lat=2422.381161915224&lon=4740.134275490913).  This is a three hour movie originally entitled “The Klansman” playing back to back to back to back non-stop for back to back to back to back days, for never before seen prices. Wow.  The parade, they say, extends for miles.  They ask every single automobile owner in the city to make available their cars for the parade.  Five hundred horses are gathered for this parade.  They literally go on to say that their party is bigger than mardi gras.  They gave away cars at the national reunion to several lucky racists.  

In that newspaper, specifically, they tell a story about the “birth of our city,” if you will. [From Little Acorns Big Oaks Grow](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc135846/m1/19/zoom/?resolution=4&lat=1397.4210424364974&lon=1812.2887550026617). Read the story.  These dudes are glorified as the fathers of our city, in a special edition of a paper that is glorifying the birth of a nation. They say in that paper, that yeah we know Tulsa has blown up in the past twenty years since its incorporation, but [what will happen in the next five years will greatly overshadow everything that's been done](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc135846/m1/19/zoom/?resolution=1&lat=1068.591585580466&lon=3031.126920335823).  Oil game was crushing it, especially with the war time needs for oil, followed by the industrial explosion after WW1.  Think about all the cars they made after the economy switched from wartime to peacetime production.  Catalog purchasing became popular in this time.  People were told [to buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzrRoDd9CxM). And boy did they get everyone onto buying cars.  They were booming, the oil business was[ pretty pretty pretty good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_05qJTeNNI).  Have you walked thru these buildings in downtown tulsa, with their fuckin tunnels?  These people weren't just living it up, they were setting it up.  

Ok we gotta fast forward thru some real crazy times to get back to September 1921.  But, let’s keep in mind the[ Red Summer of 1919](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=red+summer+of+1919) and obviously the [Tulsa Race Massacre ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-ItsPBTFO0)that happened just months before this reunion.  Also, in August 1921, just six weeks before the reunion, and a couple months after the massacre, [C A Ridley came through Tulsa to fully recruit new klansman at the convention hall](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/i6ds9c/today_in_1921_free_at_the_convention_hall_tulsa/).  Anyway, the 1921 statewide confederate reunion seems to follow the blueprint from 1918, there’s free train rides, a fair, a parade, southern memorial association is there, there’s a ball at convention hall, again the city rolls out the red carpet.  

On the 17th of September 1921, Sam Kennedy hosted a BBQ, you can read about it in [the Tulsa Daily World the next day](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc77855/m1/1/zoom/?q=%22sam%20kennedy%22&resolution=2.000187543366664&lat=4309.254650639994&lon=1947.276955199462).   That was a Saturday, that BBQ.  [The day before that](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc77854/m1/1/zoom/?q=september%2017,%201921&resolution=2&lat=4560.502385166836&lon=2621.6466851460273), the free fair started and ran all the way until the 20th, which just so happens to be the same day the confederate reunion started its three day circle jerk, how conveniently timed.  Notice who [makes front page headlines](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc77853/m1/1/zoom/?q=september%2016,%201921&resolution=2&lat=4652.724790336402&lon=4115.979380791045) the [two days leading up to the fair kick off](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc77852/m1/1/zoom/?q=september%2015,%201921&resolution=2&lat=4568.853118896484&lon=4054.89114822707), showing off their powers of protection and also [charitable goodwill](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc77853/m1/1/zoom/?q=september%2016,%201921&resolution=2.000002215815119&lat=780.5465758987893&lon=4439.5188255898365) (hint: it’s the klan). On September 21, 1921, the date on the monument, the [confederate reunion held its southern ball at the convention hall](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc77858/m1/1/zoom/?q=september%201921%20tulsa&resolution=2&lat=3462.416303916072&lon=4329.844161011754).  

The next day the confederates have their parade.  They loved parades.  This time it was mostly automobiles because the confederate veterans were getting too old, one old timer even fell and broke himself. Here is[ the route of the parade](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc77859/m1/1/zoom/?q=september%201921%20tulsa&resolution=1&lat=2788.5026973418476&lon=1062.540460138342), and [a big HD map](https://i.redd.it/kv8pnzhhtrh51.jpg) if you wanna try and visualize it. I imagine on a map it makes the shape of a stumpy dick, just like the monument, but I could be wrong. There’s an especially fucked up line in there where two grey coats are talking about how great of a city Tulsa has become, [so much so they got their shoes shined free of charge on the way into the ball](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc77859/m1/1/zoom/?q=september%201921%20tulsa&resolution=1&lat=1765.4869727737196&lon=1121.5638778068428).  This great city, just three and a half months prior, burned 40 city blocks to the ground after an incident ""started"" by a black shoe shiner.

So, here we are, the end of a massive statewide confederate reunion, It goes down like this… Confederate Idiot Voice (Donald Trump Jr will work)…”before we all go home I think it’s [important to all be on the same page about something](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc77859/m1/1/zoom/?q=september%201921%20tulsa&resolution=1&lat=3623.7347521834126&lon=1125.8005940793646).  We [can’t let anyone talk poorly of the glories of the south](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc77859/m1/1/zoom/?q=september%201921%20tulsa&resolution=1&lat=486.57701290381374&lon=1211.0919419068732).  When we go home, [we need to be sure to use **all means possible** to collaborate with the sons and daughters of the confederate veterans, and the historical societies, and the public libraries, and those who make school curriculums, and we need to be sure to go ahead and filter everyone’s history, so they know what the story is](https://gateway.okhistory.org/ark:/67531/metadc77859/m1/2/zoom/?q=september%201921%20tulsa&resolution=2&lat=4388.563838833295&lon=1701.1995997573395).

Make it so bad[ a non-American has to tell us how fuckin upside down we have it a hundred years from now](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/i36ecv/us_history_last_week_tonight_with_john_oliver_hbo/).  And while we’re at it, let’s be sure to continue [“to perpetuate the memories](https://www.hmdb.org/PhotoFullSize.asp?PhotoID=408583)” of those who got the story straight from the start.  Maybe even[ cast into stone, history as it **should be** remembered](https://i.redd.it/sq0db1dj93j51.png).  Because why the fuck else would you engrave some shit into marble, right fellas. Here Here.” 

I don't think the klan was anywhere close to its most powerful point in Tulsa’s history in 1921.  These guys had such a following they had to build a brand new 3000 person klavern, just to keep everyone under one roof.  They called it [Beno Hall](https://thislandpress.com/2011/09/03/beno-hall-tulsas-den-of-terror/), as in “Be no DigitalHypnosis or u/Blue-Steele in this building.”  Right there on Main Street, just north of Cain’s, on the other side of the over pass.  “During the Depression, the building housed a speak-easy, then a skating rink, then a lumberyard, and finally a dance hall before radio evangelist Steve Pringle turned it into the Evangelistic Temple of the First Pentecostal Church. In his first revival meeting, Pringle introduced a little-known Enid preacher by the name of Oral Roberts, who worked his animated, faith-healing magic on the bare lot next door. Roberts impressed in the tent atmosphere and preached with his cohort inside the vast auditorium once known as Beno Hall. His fire and brimstone was a fitting bookend to the fiery crusades of the Klan.”  Shoutout ORU graduate, Lt Gov Matt PInnell. Heard ‘fitting bookend.’

Wasn’t until 1935 the TAP decided to make a monument to perpetuate the memories of their association.  Now, the monument says the association started in 1921 but didn’t allow membership until 1934.  This is a total and flat out assumption I am making, but I would be willing to bet they bought that marble phallus with some sort of new member fees.  Anyway, they presented it to [Sam Kennedy](http://www.tulsagal.net/2010/09/), who kept it at his farm.  There were just two “shafts,” the tall one with the engraving and the little pretty perfect picnic placemat piece.  The large horizontal slab with all the names was added later.  Can you imagine buying the Kennedy mansion in 2020 and those two pieces of marble are in the backyard?  Like in some alternate universe where the original shit stayed where it originally was, without being moved to a public park, and then additional rock slabs and storylines added to it.   It hits a lot different when you think about it like that huh.  When its not in ""Tulsa's first park,"" next to the ""oldest house in Tulsa.""

It wasn’t until after Kennedy died, that the monument was eventually moved to Owen Park in segregated Tulsa, 1950.  In 1947, [The Association of Pioneers “gifted” an acre of land to the city on the terms that the monument could be erected there, and they could hold their annual picnic in the park, “Old-Timers Day.”  City was like “bet.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/htrjy2/why_do_you_think_they_moved_it/) The Association of Pioneers came back a couple months later and gave the city something like four more acres.  To be honest, I don't think the monument sits where it’s supposed to sit, technically, if we look back at the 1947 Tulsa World article about placement. Anyway, it's there now, becoming more discolored every year, [white naked ladies popping up late every summer](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tvlse/comments/ibrr2t/quiz_what_kind_of_flower_is_planted_around_the/).  Ask anyone about it, guaranteed, they've never heard about it.  If they have heard of it, you're probably talking to me, or pope, who’s also me so….   

And this is the reality we’re in now.  [The shadow reality built for us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTAKdXoeOlk), by people who gave not two stinky fucks about anything except acquiring polarizingly massive amounts of generational wealth, at the expense of everyone else, especially anyone in their way, especially Indians and especially Black people.  This shit still exists, we see it everyday.  

It's 2020, it's corona and quarantine and protest and [klanny monuments sittin on stolen land, Tulsa, MCN](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/idrryp/upvote_this_so_when_people_google_b2bgctm_this/). 

But you know what’s dope as fuck, besides this 24 hour happy hour hyperlink sauce buffet, Tulsa is “our” town.  It was an “old town” to people in the 1500’s… it’s been here nawmsayin, we’ve been here, as humans.  People have been here in this spot for a very long time, and will continue to be if we don't kill ourselves off.  What’s cool as Hell to me, is what other spot can say all that shit.  This is some pretty radical shit.  And here we are, the buckle on the unbuckled bible belt, the city, a contradiction of itself.  Here we are trying to figure out how to move forward and how to unite people *with* this information.  “The enemy of my enemy is my friend.”  Our common enemy is how history is told.  

We gotta get the story straight, so we can start to work together.  It’s time for us to use all means possible.  All fucking means possible.  They did.  It’s time to collaborate with historical societies, and libraries, and museums, and school curriculum, and cultural centers, and concert halls, and public speakers, and public parks, and radio stations, and websites, and tv networks, and social media, and art galleries, and city committees and commissions and fuckin everything.   It’s time for a full hard switch or we’re fucked.  We’re gonna have to re-learn history but our kids shouldn’t have to.  

AND, We should celebrate this[ awakening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9HA1CUltjQ), because this is[ necessary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmJYZ1NIn1Y).  It’s time to un-learn and re-imagine.  How’s this hot take… We are so super lucky to have something so tangible and mystified as this monument to be able to rally this message around.  And of course we would have something so poetically perfect because this is it.  This is why we’re “[the center of the universe](https://tulsaworld.com/archive/living-wright-cool-tulsa-landmark-center-of-the-universe-has-magical-mystery/article_3d1dac91-18a1-5b98-a086-a5cd4d7816d1.html).”  We’re gonna be in the national spotlight next year, just let that sink in for a little bit.  How is our city going to address all this?  I want my city to act in a way I can be proud of, and show people, Tulsa does it right.    

Look, I’m done fucking around here, [who’s with me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IXOK0b4_kk) besides flipper here?  Lets move that fuckin rock into a museum, where it belongs, so that its story can be told in the great detail that it deserves.  Let’s plant a bunch of trees and flowers in its place, ‘100 trees for 100 years.’  Give the park back to the people, give it back to the Earth.  Make it a place of love and reconciliation, a place of understanding and empathy and community.  No more monument, no more “Old-Timer’s Day.”  That's just ridiculous.  And move it out of the fuckin park soon so the Indian Community can enjoy their re-dedication of the Indian Memorial in peace.  Let’s do this shit. 

This is our Tulsa.  This land, is our land, nawmsayin.  We gotta come together, and we can come together in the park.

irg0gc,Megathread: Tropical Storm/Hurricane Sally,"#What is Damp May Never Dry!
**This thread has been updated as of 3pm on 9/14**

A storm is in the gulf and might be headed our way. As such, it's time for a megathread!

**In order to make it easier and provide current information to individuals, please keep the conversations surrounding the storm to this thread.**  We are trying to consolidate the more serious conversations/information to this thread. **It is highly recommend that you sort comments by new given the changing environment** 

For the time being, memes and funny-ish posts can be standalone posts. This is subject to change depending on how the situation evolves. Despite all the humor surrounding it, please take this event seriously and make plans based upon your needs.

Below is some general information/advice, but should not be taken as official recommendations. **Please listen to local/national authorities in determining your next course of actions.** I will try to update this post with current information when I can. 

Once the storm gets closer to landfall, we will switch from this standalone post to the /r/TropicalWeather live thread as it's a great resource to get up to date information on the storm.

P.S. If you believe something should be appended/amended to this post, please let me know and I'll be happy to consider it.

#What is happening? 

Hurricane Sally is off the SE Coast of Louisiana and is anticipated to keep moving NW towards the Louisiana/Mississippi Gulf Coast over the next 48 hours. The storm is projected to reach hurricane force winds before making landfall sometime between very late Monday night/Tuesday morning. **Most models are now predicting a Cat 2-3 landfall.** 

This storm is not necessarily going to be a huge wind concern - but due to the slow moving nature of the storm, this is expected to be a **major** rain event with **up to 10""** anticipated over the next week. 

As of 2:40pm on 9/14, the storm has moved slightly more east and we're expecting an Gulfport/Biloxi landfall. We're still not out of the woods yet, but it looks like we might get some western rain bands (as dry as the western side looks). **Expect the worst, hope for the best.** 

#Where can I get more information on projected paths, evacuation notices, and general preparation information?

#Cat 3 then flee, otherwise I'm staying.

Cool. Good For You! Some people aren't so lucky and can't afford to stay. However, here's some general advice for those of us who are new to those whole hurricane thing:

* **Expect your power to go out.** Entergy NOLA is a regulated monopoly and it's hot garbage. You should anticipate your power going out for up to a month in the middle of September. 
* **Expect it to flood.** If you're expecting the SWBNO to do their job, I have a bridge to sell you. Move your cars to the neutral ground or a high spot. 
* **Wear your damn masks.** THIS IS A 2020 COMBO SPECIAL!
* **Fill up your gas tanks.** Or charge your electric car. Doesn't matter, just make sure you can leave if you need to. 
* **Stock up on your essentials.** Do this now. Do not wait.
* **Get cash from the ATM.** What? You think credit cards and apple pay works during a power outage? Nope! Prepare to go analog and get some cold hard cash from the ATM. When you need to go to Schwegmann's to get some rice and beans, you'll be able to pay. 
* **Get you and your pets medicines.** This is often overlooked. If you have essential medical needs, get your refills now (this includes the good bois and cool cats and kittens).
* **Fill up your bathtub the night before.** Boil advisories are expected and you will need water to flush the toilets. 
* **Put bottled water in the freezer.** Trust me on this one, fill your freezer to the MAX with water bottles. It will keep your freezer colder for longer and you'll have cool water during an extended power outage. Also, keep your fridge and freezer closed for as long as you can.
* **Charge your spare batteries.** If you have external rechargeable batteries for your phones, charge them up now. This includes laptops as well - you can charge your phone with a laptop! 
* **Turn around, don't drown.** Do not be a dumbass and drive through high water. I don't care if your Tesla can float or if your F150 is lifted for her pleasure. Don't drive through high water.

#What should I buy?

[/r/TropicalWeather has a fantastic mega-thread on this that I am stealing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/bvdivw/2019_hurricane_supplies_megathread/) I highly recommend visiting this link and making sure that you have all of these things in your household.

Also pop-tarts. All the pop-tarts. Brown sugar for life though.  

#How much alcohol should I stock up on?

Yes. 

#What about public transportation? Will it still be operational?

While a lot of people don't have reliable alternative transportation, always make sure you have a plan. In general, you shouldn't expect public transport to operate during a hurricane. Don't rely upon it. Make plans to move to a safe location or a shelter/evacuation center *prior to the storm.* 

Should you need evacuation notices and/or assistance, please review the N[ew Orleans Regional Transit Authority's website](http://www.norta.com/Getting-Around/Hurricane-Preparedness) for further information on public transportation and and out of the city in the event of a mandatory evacuation.

[Update as of 9/13 from RTA:](https://twitter.com/NewOrleansRTA/status/1305300448740605953) 

> In preparation for expected impacts of Hurricane Sally to the Gulf Coast region, the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority will suspend all bus and streetcar service **beginning at noon on Monday, September 14th.** Ferry services will be suspended after normal operations on Sunday, September 13. Services will remain suspended until further notice.

#What schools will be closed?

itfxvm,"Tesla Owners: please consider helping deliver food to at-risk, food-insecure families in NYC","Next week, on Thursday, September 24th, we are teaming up with Tesla Owners to utilize their cargo capacity and HEPA air-filters to deliver food packages to immunocompromised families. Food pantries offer a vital lifeline for many NYC residents, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, but these organizations don’t typically offer delivery. That means families that depend on these services are forced to take unnecessary exposure risks to access food and other social services. To address this gap, we’re asking Tesla owners to join our efforts to deliver food boxes from WSCAH to those in need, allowing those most vulnerable to COVID-19 to stay safely in their homes.

If you have a Tesla (I specifically drive a Model 3, but I believe this would be an issue with any of them) and are driving down any of the roads that have a Black Lives Matter mural, be sure to turn off autosteer.


The autosteer functionality on those roads may be limited and possibly dangerous. My car did not detect lane boundaries when driving over or around the mural on Troost.


It's a small thing to notice, but I just hope people around are safe with their autosteer near the murals. They generally are on roads that autosteer or FSD may not be used as often, however if it is it could be a hazard to watch for.

j65ume,Megathread: Hurricane Delta,"#What is Damp May Never Dry!
**This thread has been updated as of 8:30pm on 10/8**

**The next update will be a live thread when the storm is about to make landfall - sometime Friday evening.**

Guess what? It’s 2020 and *another* hurricane is in the gulf ([that’s right I said it](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/j57yt0/you_know_what/)) putting New Orleans in the C O N E  O F  U N C E R T A I N T Y (6x). Get your Cosmic Brownies ready, because this one hasn’t moved much in the models. 

**In order to make it easier and provide current information to individuals, please keep the conversations surrounding the storm to this thread.** We are trying to consolidate the more serious conversations/information to this thread. **This post is automatically set to sort by new. It is highly recommend that you sort comments by new given the changing environment.** 

For the time being, memes and funny-ish posts can be standalone posts. This is subject to change depending on how the situation evolves. Despite all the humor surrounding it, please take this event seriously and make plans based upon your needs.

Below is some general information/advice, but should not be taken as official recommendations. **Please listen to local/national authorities in determining your next course of actions.** I will try to update this post with current information when I can. 

Once the storm gets closer to landfall, we will switch from this standalone post to the /r/TropicalWeather live thread as it's a great resource to get up to date information on the storm.

P.S. If you believe something should be appended/amended to this post, please let me know and I'll be happy to consider it.

#What is happening? 

Hurricane Delta is expected to make landfall at the current moment on Friday evening around Cameron, LA as a Cat 3. The storm is projected to move swiftly from the area and be in Northern Louisiana / Mississippi by Saturday. Unfortunately, this track makes an already battered Lake Charles the target of another hurricane. Thankfully, the impact to New Orleans at this time is probably minimal.

#Where can I get more information on projected paths, evacuation notices, and general preparation information?

As always, we recommend paying attention to local and national media forecasts. Here are some official government links for you to monitor:

#Cat 3 then flee, otherwise I'm staying.

Cool. Good For You! Some people aren't so lucky and can't afford to stay. However, here's some general advice for those of us who are new to those whole hurricane thing:

* **Expect your power to go out.** Entergy NOLA is a regulated monopoly and it's hot garbage. You should anticipate your power going out for up to a month in the middle of October (Maybe Sweater Weather). 
* **Expect it to flood.** If you're expecting the SWBNO to do their job, I have a bridge to sell you. Move your cars to the neutral ground or a high spot. 
* **Wear your damn masks.** THIS IS A 2020 COMBO SPECIAL!
* **Fill up your gas tanks.** Or charge your electric car. Doesn't matter, just make sure you can leave if you need to. 
* **Stock up on your essentials.** Do this now. Do not wait. Cosmic Brownies will sell out.
* **Get cash from the ATM.** What? You think credit cards and apple pay works during a power outage? Nope! Prepare to go analog and get some cold hard cash from the ATM. When you need to go to Schwegmann's to get some rice and beans, you'll be able to pay. 
* **Get you and your pets medicines.** This is often overlooked. If you have essential medical needs, get your refills now (this includes the good bois and cool cats and kittens).
* **Fill up your bathtub the night before.** Boil advisories are expected and you will need water to flush the toilets. 
* **Put bottled water in the freezer.** Trust me on this one, fill your freezer to the MAX with water bottles. It will keep your freezer colder for longer and you'll have cool water during an extended power outage. Also, keep your fridge and freezer closed for as long as you can.
* **Charge your spare batteries.** If you have external rechargeable batteries for your phones, charge them up now. This includes laptops as well - you can charge your phone with a laptop! 
* **Turn around, don't drown.** Do not be a dumbass and drive through high water. I don't care if your Tesla can float or if your F150 is lifted for her pleasure. Don't drive through high water.

#How much alcohol should I stock up on?

Yes.

#What about public transportation? Will it still be operational?

While a lot of people don't have reliable alternative transportation, always make sure you have a plan. In general, you shouldn't expect public transport to operate during a hurricane. Don't rely upon it. Make plans to move to a safe location or a shelter/evacuation center *prior to the storm.* 

Should you need evacuation notices and/or assistance, please review the [New Orleans Regional Transit Authority's website](http://www.norta.com/Getting-Around/Hurricane-Preparedness) for further information on public transportation and and out of the city in the event of a mandatory evacuation.

Update as of 10/6 from RTA:

The eye is projected to move over the greater New Orleans area. Landfall is expected sometime around 3-5pm on October 28th. Take precautions now and prepare for a stronger than anticipated hurricane to roll through. As always, please listen to local, state and national government officials on the actions and steps you need to take.

#NOLAReady states that you should be prepared to SHELTER IN PLACE by 2pm today. Take this advice from local leaders.

If they ever IPO, head on over to /r/wallstreetbets and throw tendies at them. I digress, this is a tropical *depression* megathread. Anyways, this scientologist-god sounding named storm called Zeta is rolling into the gulf and has put us back in the C O N E O F U N C E R T A I N T Y. Might as well put the entire US in the cone since the election is next week. **P.S. Go vote if you haven't.**

#What is happening? 

Zeta, the **sixth** letter of the greek alphabet and more annoying sister/brother/thing to Cthulhu, has arisen from the seas and is now entering the Gulf. In what is most assuredly the worst prank ever by NOAA Meteorologists, New Orleans is enjoying it's 7th time in the Cone of Uncertainty. 

**Hurricane Zeta has a very high probability to hit New Orleans.** Latoya did not activate the shield quick enough! Landfall is expected to be tomorrow evening with the storm quickly - and I mean quickly - going over New Orleans. The eye is anticipated to be above New Orleans around 3-5pm and gone by 12pm/1am. 

Please prepare for a high strength Category 1 storm tomorrow (10/28) by mid-day.

#What schools will be closed?

Schools will likely be closed the day before the storm. Depending on the extent of the damage and various other factors (power, water, etc.) it's unknown for how long the schools will be closed for. 

We recommend that you monitor your local parish's school district websites for up to date information on school closures. That being said, we'll post information as it becomes available. [Please refer to this WWLTV article for up to date school closure information.
](https://www.wwltv.com/article/weather/hurricane/list-zeta-school-closures/289-691bd4c7-5513-435e-9efe-871c7a2361d7)

Please note, most of these notices apply to public schools. Most private institutions abide by the local Parish's closures, but please refer to your specific school for up to date information. 

Additional Commentary: Sorry kids, it looks like 2020 has decided that schools will just go virtual instead of close! RIP Storm Days.

#Cat 3 then flee, otherwise I'm staying.

Cool. Good For You! Some people aren't so lucky and can't afford to stay. However, here's some general advice for those of us who are new to those whole hurricane thing:

* **Expect your power to go out.** Entergy NOLA is a regulated monopoly and it's hot garbage. You should anticipate your power going out for up to a month in the middle of October (Maybe Sweater Weather). 
* **Expect it to flood.** If you're expecting the SWBNO to do their job, I have a bridge to sell you. Move your cars to the neutral ground or a high spot. 
* **Wear your damn masks.** THIS IS A 2020 COMBO SPECIAL!
* **Fill up your gas tanks.** Or charge your electric car. Doesn't matter, just make sure you can leave if you need to. 
* **Stock up on your essentials.** Do this now. Do not wait. Cosmic Brownies will sell out.
* **Get cash from the ATM.** What? You think credit cards and apple pay works during a power outage? Nope! Prepare to go analog and get some cold hard cash from the ATM. When you need to go to Schwegmann's to get some rice and beans, you'll be able to pay. 
* **Get you and your pets medicines.** This is often overlooked. If you have essential medical needs, get your refills now (this includes the good bois and cool cats and kittens).
* **Fill up your bathtub the night before.** Boil advisories are expected and you will need water to flush the toilets. 
* **Put bottled water in the freezer.** Trust me on this one, fill your freezer to the MAX with water bottles. It will keep your freezer colder for longer and you'll have cool water during an extended power outage. Also, keep your fridge and freezer closed for as long as you can.
* **Charge your spare batteries.** If you have external rechargeable batteries for your phones, charge them up now. This includes laptops as well - you can charge your phone with a laptop! 
* **Turn around, don't drown.** Do not be a dumbass and drive through high water. I don't care if your Tesla can float or if your F150 is lifted for her pleasure. Don't drive through high water.
* **GO VOTE EARLY!** It's a late October surprise. Vote early so just in case the situation gets worse, you at least know you've done your civic duty, you patriot.

#What should I buy?

[/r/TropicalWeather has a fantastic mega-thread on this that we are stealing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/bvdivw/2019_hurricane_supplies_megathread/) We highly recommend visiting this link and making sure that you have all of these things in your household.

Also pop-tarts. All the pop-tarts. Brown sugar for life though.  

New for October: C O S M I C  B R O W N I E S

#How much alcohol should I stock up on?

Yes.

#What about public transportation? Will it still be operational?

While a lot of people don't have reliable alternative transportation, always make sure you have a plan. In general, you shouldn't expect public transport to operate during a hurricane. Don't rely upon it. Make plans to move to a safe location or a shelter/evacuation center *prior to the storm.* 

Should you need evacuation notices and/or assistance, please review the [New Orleans Regional Transit Authority's website](http://www.norta.com/Getting-Around/Hurricane-Preparedness) for further information on public transportation and and out of the city in the event of a mandatory evacuation.

Update as of 10/27 from RTA: 

> In preparation for expected impacts of Hurricane Zeta, **the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority will suspend all bus, streetcar, and ferry services beginning at noon on Wednesday, October 28th.** All transit operations will remain suspended until further notice and until it is deemed safe for service to resume. 

#Sandbags?

k8j8mb,Electric vehicle owners: What's your evacuation plan?,"Now that hurricane season is _finally_ behind us and no longer a point of anxiety (at least until next year), I want to ask a question. I've been courting the idea of getting an EV whenever my gas-powered Civic finally gives up the ghost (which in all likelihood won't be for at least another few years, since it's not even a decade old). The biggest roadblock to me is one single factor: **what do I do if we have to evacuate?**

This seems to be the only situation where the ""range anxiety"" problem actually comes into play. We rarely go for long drives (the farthest we typically go is to visit some friends of ours around Kentwood), so even for our longer trips we'd have enough juice for a round-trip without recharging. But evacuation is a special case, where you're just trying to *get as far away as possible*, in the middle of stop-start traffic.

If you have an EV, have you thought about your evacuation plans? How much range do you expect to get out of your EV while crawling along with the A/C on? Will you just leave earlier and hope you can beg someone for power somewhere to charge your vehicle?",NewOrleans,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewOrleans/comments/k8j8mb/electric_vehicle_owners_whats_your_evacuation_plan/,12/7/2020 15:59,43,40,louisiana

What do you all think of articles like this? I know society is trying to find a balance between the economy and the recommended restrictions to slow the spread of the Coronavirus.

Is a leisurely getaway really necessary when people's lives are at stake? The pandemic isn't over by a long shot. There are a lot of active COVID-19 cases in L.A. I don't want them here.

He said he doesn't sleep too well some nights because of what he has witnessed over the past year with patients who contract an extreme case of the Coronavirus.

The Poster Boy F\*\*\*boi car, cuts you off, windows are probably down blaring rap or latin trap, driver is wearing a snapback or combover fade, parks poorly, does not use turn signals, will speed up when you're trying to merge onto their lane, tailgates for a hard 3.4 seconds then speeds away, I can go on all day...

Hyundai Genesis Coupe - F\*\*\*boi that can't afford a BMW

Infiniti Q Series - F\*\*\*bois that can't afford BMW but are too good for ""peasant Hyundais""

Ford F150/RAM/Chevy Silverado - Wears tactical shades, rocks a white ""Salt Life"" long sleeve shirt along with cargo shorts, most likely hits up Haulover on Sundays and has a concealed carry license.

luk277,Solar?,"  

I have acquired many quotes on solar and found a company that I think I want to stick with. It is for more power than we are currently consuming, to account for any future expansions of families or current businesses that are being run from home. I am not taking the expected price increase from APS into consideration, I just don't think that it will go down much.

The monthly payment is LESS than the lowest winter bill and less than half of the summer bills, even with the obscene financing charge. I am experiencing some anxiety about a 20-year commitment, but I could pay it off in 10 if I really wanted to and still pay less than our annual power bill expenses. Even with the expected decline of efficiency, it still should cover what we will use. Is there something else that I am not considering?

Something that's held me back has been the lack of EV charging infrastructure near Payson, as I frequently travel & camp in that area during the summer. There is a Tesla Supercharger located in Payson, but I didn't want to feel confined to only one brand.   
Well now it looks like Electrify Commercial is partnering with APS to put in some fast DC chargers in multiple Arizona locations, including Payson. Frankly I'm not super thrilled with either of those companies with their reputation of poor customer experience, but it will be great to have more charging options. I was leaning towards getting a Model Y because of Tesla's Supercharger network, but the new Ioniq 5 that was just revealed seems a bit more appealing now.

mmef8d,Best way to get Denison parking to fix the electric car chargers,"Hi All- 

I know this is not a problem everyone faces but I wanted to get some advice on how to convince Denison parking to fix the tesla chargers. Only 2 if the 8 destination chargers work and, as someone who uses the garage as their primary parking while at home, it is frustrating to come home to the few chargers that work being occupied non-stop... kind of a like a ""water water everywhere not a drop to drink"" situation. I've spoken to the folks who work in the parking office on one of my off days a couple of months ago and they made it sound like they were going to put a ticket in to get it fixed but alas, nothing has been done. I've also tried to go through the corporate website but haven't heard back from them. They definitely are falsely advertising on their signs that they have 8 working chargers and maybe I can use that as leverage? IDK...🤷‍♀️

With more people being out and about, this is probably going to be an ongoing issue. 

I'm guessing that Denison is going to just be Denison and ignore my requests but maybe one of you out there has some thoughts on how to get things done.

Update 1: Thanks for everyone's input. Either their ears were burning or it was pure coincidence but yesterday (4/9), my sentry mode caught 7 events before left for work and upon review, it looks like the garage's maintenance folks tried to fix the 6 chargers. Seems they were unsuccessful bc when I came back from work they were still flashing red. Hopefully they will reach out to Tesla... at least I now know they are trying.

mplsw0,Tesla Solar Roof availability in Central Ohio,"Would anyone have any idea or estimation as to how long it’d probably take for Tesla to start servicing the Central Ohio region ?

Also, Is it worth waiting for Tesla to start servicing Ohio, in order to get the Tesla Solar Roof + power wall (as in, by comparison of what the Tesla roof offers versus conventional solar roofing options already available in Central Ohio) ? 

My parents are buying their first ever house (in latter stages of construction) 10 minutes out of Dublin, and so I was looking into the Tesla Solar Roof & Powerwall (we’ll be buying a Tesla car in the coming years) given recommendations from friends in SoCal who rave abt it.

On a side note, will it be financially a good investment by the time we’re able to get it here (given that costs would probably continue to go down by that time) ?

I didn't know where to start so I let the guys in to hear there pitch and see what information is available.  They go through all the science and stuff which I already know and understand.  

Right now in the summer my APS bill for a 1800 foot home is about $120 in the winter and $400+ in the summer.  When I google the cost to go solar, I cant seem to find much except ads and data input sites that basically run you through a lead generator and then you get added to a list for someone to get back to you.

For a 16kWh system they want $47k for a purchased system and that just blew my mind, I didn't thinking it would be that high. Then then say then will get a finance lender to help which turns into 25 year at 3% for $165/month and then they dangle the $13k or so of incentives to say it'll get lower.   They say they cover maintenance and support, etc., but most all the panels and microinverters come with long and low maintenance manufacture warranties anyway.

Are there other options out there I'm missing for getting this power bill to come down?  Complications that I'm not seeing?

nxfgw6,Ann Arbor's Solarize Solar Panel Group Buys,"[The City of Ann Arbor has a program called Solarize](https://www.a2gov.org/departments/sustainability/Sustainability-Me/Families-Individuals/Pages/Ann-Arbor-Solarize.aspx), where they coordinate solar panel group buy discounts for people in Washtenaw County. If you are thinking about getting solar panels, you should absolutely know about this program because it could save you 15% (on top of the current 26% federal tax credit). 

I'm going through a group buy now and want to share how it works because this is a really cool program.

It starts with a few people in a neighborhood or other group who want to start a group buy. The city provides a list of participating installers, all of whom are vetted and approved by the [Michigan Saves](https://michigansaves.org/) green energy bank. The organizers talk to some of the installers, get sample bids, and then pick one for their event. The organizers then spread the word about the group buy, and people sign up to attend the Solarize informational Zoom meeting.

After the meeting, anyone who registered can get a free bid from the installer. If 3 houses get installs, everyone gets 5% off. 7 houses gets 10% off, and if 10+ houses get solar panels everyone gets 15% off. Again, that stacks with the 26% tax credit (that goes down to 22% after next year, then goes away completely after 2023).

To put some numbers around that, if your install cost is $20,000 you get 26% off for the federal tax credit, so you're down to $14,800. If you participate in a group buy with 10+ homes, you get 15% off that, so you are down to $12,580. If you finance that for 10 years at 4.5%, your loan payment is $130.38/month.

Solar panels are generally warrantied for 25 years, so the 15 years after you pay off the loan is free electricity.

Like I said above, I'm doing a group buy now and anyone in Washtenaw County is welcome to join. If you go to [the Solarize page](https://a2gov.org/solar) you can sign up for my neighborhood's event (""Country French Estates Solarize Event"") or the other one that's going on. Or you can contact them to start one for your own neighborhood! Yes, I want lots of people to join my group buy, but more importantly I want lots of solar panels on roofs.

**Please begin immediately to shelter in place. New Orleans is about to begin immediately experiencing Tropical Storm winds. You no longer have time to evacuate.**

**In order to make it easier and provide current information to individuals, please keep the conversations surrounding the storm to this thread.** We are trying to consolidate the more serious conversations/information to this thread. **This post is automatically set to sort by new. It is highly recommended that you sort comments by new given the changing environment.** 

For the time being, memes and funny-ish posts can be standalone posts. This is subject to change depending on how the situation evolves. Despite all the humor surrounding it, please take this event seriously and make plans based upon your needs.

Below is some general information/advice, but should not be taken as official recommendations. **Please listen to local/national authorities in determining your next course of actions.** I will try to update this post with current information when I can. 

Once the storm gets closer to landfall, we will switch from this standalone post to the /r/TropicalWeather live thread as it's a great resource to get up to date information on the storm.

P.S. If you believe something should be appended/amended to this post, please let me know and I'll be happy to consider it.

#What is happening? 


Hurricane Ida made landfall in SE Louisiana on Sunday at 11:55am on Grand Isle as a strong Category 4 storm. The Greater New Orleans area is on the dirty Northeastern side of the hurricane and is expected to experience hurricane force winds for the next 6-12 hours. 

Please take all precautions to shelter in place immediately.

#Cat 3 then flee, otherwise I'm staying.

Cool. Good For You! Some people aren't so lucky and can't afford to stay. However, here's some general advice for those of us who are new to those whole hurricane thing:

* **Expect your power to go out.** Entergy NOLA is a regulated monopoly and it's hot garbage. You should anticipate your power going out for up to a month in late August (SWAMPASS SEASON). 
* **Expect it to flood.** If you're expecting the SWBNO to do their job, I have a bridge to sell you. Move your cars to the neutral ground or a high spot. 
* **Wear your damn masks.** THIS IS A 2021 COMBO SPECIAL (Goddamn it, I had hoped to remove that from 2020)!
* **Fill up your gas tanks.** Or charge your electric car. Doesn't matter, just make sure you can leave if you need to. 
* **Stock up on your essentials.** Do this now. Do not wait. Cosmic Brownies will sell out.
* **Get cash from the ATM.** What? You think credit cards and apple pay works during a power outage? Nope! Prepare to go analog and get some cold hard cash from the ATM. When you need to go to Schwegmann's to get some rice and beans, you'll be able to pay. 
* **Get you and your pets medicines.** This is often overlooked. If you have essential medical needs, get your refills now (this includes the good bois and cool cats and kittens).
* **Fill up your bathtub the night before.** Boil advisories are expected and you will need water to flush the toilets. 
* **Put bottled water in the freezer.** Trust me on this one, fill your freezer to the MAX with water bottles. It will keep your freezer colder for longer and you'll have cool water during an extended power outage. Also, keep your fridge and freezer closed for as long as you can.
* **Charge your spare batteries.** If you have external rechargeable batteries for your phones, charge them up now. This includes laptops as well - you can charge your phone with a laptop! 
* **Turn around, don't drown.** Do not be a dumbass and drive through high water. I don't care if your Tesla can float or if your F150 is lifted for her pleasure. Don't drive through high water.
* **Get a Transfer Switch on your AC installed.** This is a ""pre-hurricane season"" kinda thing, but if your power goes out for an extended period and you get ahold of a big boy generator, you'll want that thing to power your AC.

#How much alcohol should I stock up on?

Yes.

#What about public transportation? Will it still be operational?

While a lot of people don't have reliable alternative transportation, always make sure you have a plan. In general, you shouldn't expect public transport to operate during a hurricane. Don't rely upon it. Make plans to move to a safe location or a shelter/evacuation center *prior to the storm.* 

Should you need evacuation notices and/or assistance, please review the [New Orleans Regional Transit Authority's website](http://www.norta.com/Getting-Around/Hurricane-Preparedness) for further information on public transportation and and out of the city in the event of a mandatory evacuation.

Update as of 8/28 from RTA: 

> * Ferry Service will be suspended after 6pm on 8/27.
> * [Streetcar Service will be suspended beginning Saturday, August 28 @ 3am.](https://www.facebook.com/NewOrleansRTA/posts/4368978316472795) Bus service will be available and RTA will waive all fares across the city for hurricane preparation.

#Can you sharpie this situation away?

Neither NOAA nor FEMA recommends this. It doesn't work.

#I'm a tourist and I have plans to come, should I still come?

If you're asking this question after reading all of the above including the section, ""Mandatory and/or Voluntary"" Evacuations"", [heeeere's your sign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBjelRDKHUk). In all seriousness, shit is about to get real for us. Some of us are going to evacuate. Some of us will stay. We're making plans. You should make that decision yourself, but chances are pretty damn good that a hotel and/or airline will make that choice for you.

pej2ru,Comed Hourly Pricing Review after three years,"Hey all,

Just want to share my experience using Comed hourly pricing in case anyone is thinking of joining as there doesn't seem to be much material out there for reviews. The last post on this is over 2 years old.  For the record I have a 2 BR condo, do laundry 2x/week, no electric car or anything out of the ordinary. My unit does have its own water heater and AC unit and I use an ecobee to raise/lower temps based on time of day to save.

I have used it for about three years and have come to the conclusion it is not worth it for the average person. In total, I have saved 5% over three years which is $50. Taking into account how you need to check the pricing table before doing any high usage activity and save it for late night/early mornings, that savings is negligible.

When I started I thought it was a great program that could save me a lot on my bill but there are a few caveats that I can explain here that will get you.

1. Capacity Charge- This charge is fairly complex on how they calculate it and it comes down to how much electricity you use on the hottest day of the year and then they charge you the same rate for the entire year based on that usage. This usually is the average of maybe 5 days in the summer. So unless you're willing to be out of town or not use AC on those days, you will be screwed paying a high capacity charge for the rest of the year which is the highest impact of the bill from what I found.
2. Hourly rates - for the most part, the price is cheaper during the night and mornings but the amount of pricing spikes throughout the day just makes it not worth it. They show a forecast each day on what they anticipate the price to be, but the price will easily jump from 5c (average) to 40c randomly and if you don't have notifications on or some smart logic, you may eat through your savings in the matter of an hour. This is especially true during the summer months or anytime there is some natural disaster event going on anywhere in the country, think texas grid shut down or hurricane.
3. One perk I felt they sell you upfront is the chance the price goes below 0, you actually make money to use electricity. Well this happened maybe 3 times over 3 years. There is an 1000% chance more that you see a spike in pricing than any kind of close to 0 price.
4. IFTT integration isn't that good. I initially set up my ecobee to use it but there is a lot of limits to what you can connect and what Comed offers as integrations. I hope they build more automations but from what I tried, it was very limited.

In short I think Comed does a pretty bad job keeping prices close to forecast and making this program really worth it. Their mismanagement is directly is passed on to users of the hourly pricing program leaving you losing money and stressed out.

With that said, it's possible you have a different experience if you have a different type of environment such as a tesla to charge overnight or the ability to truly automate usage in your smart home.

Hope this helps but let me know if you have any questions.",chicago,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/pej2ru/comed_hourly_pricing_review_after_three_years/,8/30/2021 14:21,103,41,illinois

pf80kz,Emissions Testing--how long to plan for?,"I'm planning to change our car registrations from Michigan (where we moved from a couple months ago) to Arizona at the end of the week (already have a DMV appointment scheduled).  My car is a Tesla, so no emissions testing is required, but I need to get my wife's 2018 Subaru in.  I know it's practically a rubber stamp, but I need to get the stamp, and with the testing centers open 8-5, I'll need to carve out some time from my work day.

Is there a time I should target that's better than others (I can shuffle my schedule pretty easily), and how long should I plan on it taking?  The testing center up on 22nd and Stocker is the most convenient for me, but Renaissance isn't too bad either.

Edit: another poster helped me find that new cars are exempt for the first 5 years, so it looks like we can skip this step for the 2018 Subaru.

qcctnh,Daily Parking Around Northern Allentown?,"Hopefully I’m posting this in accordance to the rules, but I’m heading to Pittsburgh for the first time in a few weeks for a concert and I’m looking for daily weekend parking options around northern Allentown. Our hotel says they only allow one vehicle per room and we have at least 2, maybe 3 vehicles between us. They also said there’s extremely limited parking options in town.

One other thing (I promise I’m not trying to sound pretentious) is that I drive a new Tesla so I don’t want to cheap out on parking and risk getting it vandalized or stolen from. I’d like to get parking that has charging available but that’s probably a long shot as well.

Anyone have any solid advice? The person who is parking at the hotel says he can pick me up from wherever I find parking and bring me back a few days later when we head out. I am considering the airport but that’s 20+ minutes away.

qeaffp,Shooting on Haight St yesterday. Broad Day Light.,"Since I've seen no news reports about this I decided to write a post. I was walking down Haight street towards Buena vista park yesterday (Oct 22) when a car (black SUV) pulled onto the street in the wrong lane. I noticed the car immediately as it had bullet holes in the windshield, and again, was in the wrong lane. There was a man in the passenger seat wearing a balaclava type mask where only his eyes were visible. I didn't see the driver. The car drove down Haight past me. I asked another pedestrian if he too had seen the car. He said, ""yea he's going to kill someone driving like that"". He apparently had not noticed the bullet holes in the windshield. I few seconds later the pops started, at least 10 to 15 gunshots, and I decided to move off of Haight street - Fast. I walked onto Waller St, and followed the street in the same direction at which point I noticed people hanging out of their apartment windows. I yelled up to a girl in a window to ask if she saw what I saw. She told me that the car in question pulled onto Waller and Central (where i was standing) maybe 1 minute earlier at which point a man exited the vehicle, stood in the road, and fired several rounds down the street before getting back into the vehicle. There were casings on the ground there, and a bullet hole in a tesla. I continued down Waller and took a left on Buena Vista Ave W. There were many people at the intersection of Haight and Buena Vista Ave W (at the bottom of the hill), and there were casings all over the ground there as well. The cops began to arrive. Ritual Coffee shop's window was shattered with at least a couple bullet holes. I was asked to stay and speak with the police, and give my story.

s6mwp2,Anyone remember The Venue @ The Hub?,"Since The Venue @ Hub closed in 2014, Fargo has had a huge hole in concert facilities. If you are unfamiliar, it was in the Avalon building on 25th  and had a main level and a mezzanine. [Click here for a picture](https://www.bassnectar.net/wp-content/gallery/family-photos/bn-familyphoto-20130927-fargo-photo-by-max-hoage.jpg)

It was big time for concerts (see list below) and unfortunately with our current facilities,  most of these shows are not possible. It's not because they don't want to come here or didn't draw well. No place to put them

At the time the Venue added the mezzanine level, it was the #98 largest club in the nation with a capacity of 2,800. It was a sweet spot for shows and it routinely got Minneapolis shows

We now see less concerts like that because: 

\- The Fargodome is way too big

\- Scheels arena is too big at 6,000

\- Bluestem, The Lights and Fargo Brewing, are outdoor facilities, and can only be used in the summer. Plus they can't go late with noise ordinances

\- Fargo Theater only holds about 1,000, but no general admission and it has permanent chairs

\- The Sanctuary holds around 800.

\- The Hall at Fargo Brewing &  Aquarium is under 400

How can we get a 3k seat indoor concert facility with a mezzanine level like the Venue had?

The City of Fargo and Fargodome wants to build a convention center attached to the dome. It seems like a good opportunity to turn one end of it into a building similar to The Venue @ The Hub was. It could still be used for convention space and business meetings

Then tear the Fargo Civic down because they let it fall into disrepair and let them build the performing Arts Center there. That building will not be suitable for concerts. It will have permanent seats.

If the goal is to attract concerts, tourist dollars and attract a workforce (people want to live where things are going on), this seems like home run

Here is an incomplete list of shows held at The Venue  back in the day.  Unfortunately we have no place to put them so they skip Fargo

s9juia,Solar loans kinda suck,"Ok it's not insanely high, but I have Tesla solar panels.

They opened my loan through a bank called Spectrum Credit Union.

I HATE this bank.They make it damn near impossible to pay my loan.The website rarely works. When it does work, I can't actually access the invisible payment schedule they setup for me. I have to call them (and wait on hold for an hour) every single time I want to do anything regarding the schedule, paying extra, etc.

Trying to setup an external account to transfer money in manually is a nightmare.  Can't pay the loan via debit card (this is pretty normal for loans, but still a complaint).  They did recently add Zelle but I'm already setup with a different bank and don't think I can use Zelle for multiple banks.

&#x200B;

I could probably list a hundred complaints, but that aside, the interest rate starts at 4.99% no matter how good your credit is.

Why can cars get as low as 1% apr, but you're locked into whatever for Solar?No options to refinance for any loan services I've looked at. My only options seem to be a second mortgage or a personal loan. Personal loan's all seem to be pretty high (wells fargo starts at 5.99%).

I don't remember the reason I declined the second mortgage option, though.

&#x200B;

Anyways utility companies aside, Arizona really needs to step up its solar game.

&#x200B;

Edit: To clarify, since it apparently needs to be said. I'm relatively happy with my solar panel purchase. I just hate the loan itself. And I'm confused why I can get a 2% APR loan on a car, or I can refinance to 1-2% APR on a car which costs less than Solar.    
But the lowest rate you can get on Solar is 5% and there are no services that refinance loans like that.  ",phoenix,https://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/s9juia/solar_loans_kinda_suck/,1/21/2022 20:17,43,71,arizona

sfyigv,"Posting this again after talking to the mods, my experience working at Tesla Giga1. USA Parkway, NV","

Hey all, so this is getting enough attention to get me kicked off the main Tesla subs. Kind of expected but disappointing, just like my experience working for this company.

Here's a condensed version of it. If you want to see the whole thing, check out r/workreform or r/RealTesla

   I started working at Tesla as a contractor at the many temp agencies in town. The pay was ok, slightly better than the typical warehouse or retail jobs in town but still not enough to pay rent in the local skyrocketing real estate market. Stock options are nice but you have to survive a year or so to collect.

  Tesla’s breakroom is actually one of the better perks about working there. Fresh and free coffee, cereal and oatmeal to get you energized for the day. I used to often take advantage of this but with the ebb and flow of associates and contractors sometimes finding a seat, especially post Covid, was a challenge and I resolved to eat a lunchable in my car.

The selling points for me was a set schedule and often 3 to 4 day a week off and you can often take overtime when you need it but the job is very physical so most of the time you need that time off. In the beginning my feet would be bleeding and raw by the time I got home and my body stiff from the 12 hour days.

Contracting is probably the worst part about my whole experience working at Giga1. Tesla has a mantra that is often bandied about in group meetings that involve policy violations, such as the aforementioned 1 minute late off a break. Basically they will go over the policy, the consequence of violating that policy, with the caveat that if you are a contractor “your contract will immediately end.” So you are constantly living in fear of getting fired over something stupid like not getting to a timeclock on time by -1- minute. Which happened to me twice in a 6 month period and yes I got talked to about it both times. During my contract, I never called out but a couple of my friends who did got texts from the contracting agency saying they could be terminated. One of these guys had a very sick child at home.

Even in orientation, I only remember Tesla’s mission statement about “making a better planet through renewable energy” and the talk about how their Opsec section was all ex CIA and they will know if you take photos in the building or text badly about them on social media and provided one example of a lady who did exactly that and when they found out, they terminated her immediately.

This is why you won’t see the constant and repetitive safety violations that happen there. Blocked fire exits and doors, forklift operators that will fly by you completely violating the companies own policies with impunity. Except honking, they are pretty good at that.

You also won’t see the graffiti in the bathrooms and on equipment and in elevators saying stuff like “kill me” and “I get highly educated” and during the summer riots, lots of stuff about BLM and PoC in the bathrooms.

You may have heard of the that one person who got their fingers chopped off or the person who fell through a hole in a floor. Having been injured several times there, my eye still not fully recovered from one such injury, I can safely say Tesla is not about preventing accidents but instead reacting to these things as they happen, sometimes with no resolution.

One hilarious and sad example of this is an area I call the “meat grinder”. I call it that because most people who end up there rarely last more than a few weeks because of the difficulty and mind dulling, repetitive nature of the work.

Because of the NDA, I won’t go into detail what exactly gets done there but the work area is surrounded by an oven. As you can imagine, this area gets very hot but despite this, all through the last summer we had like 3 fans for the whole area and 25-30 people that work there. During this time at least 2 different people had heat related incidents that required medical attention. One of them didn’t come back.

One day in the middle of this heat wave a whole bunch of fans show up, like 30 or so. Naturally, we assume they were for us and hey, better late than never!

No, those fans weren’t for us, they were for the parts coming out of the oven. All of them. To top it off they were never even turned on and they still sit there months later with no power.

The associates did finally get our own big fans, eventually, after summer was over and they will probably be broke by next summer.

This is from a company that impressed me with their engineering skills initially. If you have a tool required for your job, it is probably built in house and improved on over and over again in real time. Anything that makes the job more efficient will see revisions and improvements again and again. And when something breaks related to production, it gets replaced right away.

You won’t see this in safety. Long heavy poles that move parts are never secured after being used and even when personally being struck and injured by one and suggesting they be secured, they still aren’t.

When my eye was damaged from powder coat last summer, my injury not treated seriously by their on site medical staff and despite being told it happens to associates “all the time” and “it’ll clear up in a day or so”, I suffered for months while it healed. To this day it still bothers me in the morning from time to time.

Then there is the management. My main experience with the Tesla supervisor culture is a woman I will call Natalie.

Natalie is exactly the sort of person you would expect to be good at operating the meat grinder that was our department. Good at planning and delegation, as well as cold and efficient with labor with a willingness to break rules and policies when it suits her and an HR department that shields her when she is called out on it.

At first I sort of admired her, she was well spoken and seemed to have a creative mind when she wasn’t reading straight from the corporate handbook. I wasn’t fond of her draconian strictness, especially coupled with her obvious favoritism of a select group of associates but this was a new field for me and I figured my own work ethic would prevail and I could eventually climb the ladder out of this hellhole of a department and maybe do something more technical.

The working relationship was good for a while, she seemed to appreciate my passion for hard work and trusted me with more and more autonomy to get things done as well as the occasional coaching on how to be a better leader and it seemed as though I would soon see my goals realized.

Then I saw some things she was doing that was not ok and went to HR in the ill conceived notion I could bring about a positive change but instead ended up putting a target on myself that would eventually cost me my mental health as well as my career at Tesla.

A complaint I made to our HR rep(who I will call Charity) about favoritism was almost immediately met with a write up by Natalie for insubordination. The same day I witness her writing up another associate right there on the production floor in front of everyone. Something you don’t do in any job, period.

I talk with him to let him know what she did was wrong and it turns out he also made a complaint to HR the same day I did. I do what I think is my due diligence and report that to Charity and am met again with another write up, this time for attendance. That one was legitimate but it’s also one of those policies Natalie picks and chooses to apply.

For example, after this last write up and for the next couple months, Natalie would hold me in the department until exactly 6pm while letting everyone go to the timeclocks 3 to 10 min early. If this seems ridiculous it was but I put up with it because I thought FOR SURE, this was something totally unfair and retaliatory and she would be held accountable for it.

But as with my other complaints to our HR rep, this one got ignored, while Natalie would continue turning the screws because the biggest sin at this company is simply rocking the boat. They only care about results and not the people they burn up to get there.

Tesla made 1.4 billion in profit last year while taking away bonuses of almost everyone who helped them get there and blamed Covid. You know what they fed us on Christmas Day last year?

slz70a,Tips on clearing the driveway from the 2 inches of ice,"Since Saturday morning, I've been trying to clear my driveway but it is solid ice/snow. It was plowed but I have a steep incline so the top part is 2 inches deep and the bottom part is about an inch thick. My driveway doesn't get much sunlight (only a few hours in the morning when it is still cold) and I don't think the salt is going to have much effect. So far, I've used an ice scrapper to slowly chip away at the ice but I only cover a few inches before I get tired. 

Anyone have any success clearing the driveway?

EDIT: Thanks for all the feedback. Lesson learned. Next time, pre-treat and clean up during the storm. Meanwhile, my parents are going to drop off some rock salt for me since I ran out.

swtysf,Eatonville is the first all-black city to be incorporated in Florida,"Eatonville was established in 1887 after being settled two decades after the Civil War ended by former slaves.

 Located six miles north of Orlando, the town was first named Maitland and got its start when former slave, Joseph C. Clarke, along with northern philanthropist Lewis Lawrence, bought over a hundred acres of land from Josiah Eaton, one of the few white landowners willing to sell to African Americans. 

They then parceled the acres to black families from the surrounding area of central Florida. 

On the fifteenth of August, 1887, the town was officially incorporated when twenty-seven registered black voters indicated their intention to create a municipality.

t8exa4,Help picking an EV,"For background, my wife and I are thinking of moving farther out to the suburbs where rent is hundreds of dollars cheaper, apartments are more spacious, and newer.

We understand that the benefits we are getting from a cheaper rent might be offset by the cost of the car. To my estimation, it might be even (reason I'm creating this post to see if I missed anything). We might as well use the car for weekend trips that we are somewhat limited now due to the high cost of rental (and now gas).

Here's a list I put together of cost and range (ordered by price):  


|*Car*|*MSRP*|*Range (miles)*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|VW ID.4|$40,760|280|
|Ford Mustang Mach-E|$43,895|314|
|Audi Q4 e-tron|$44,000|241|
|Volvo XC40 Recharge|$51,700|223|
|Tesla Model Y \*|$60,990|318|
|BMW iX|$83,200|324|

\* without the FSD package $12,000

So besides the cost to buy, are there any hidden costs? I was reading that insurance can range between $1200 to $3000/year for some models. In terms of charging stations, Electrify America and some vendor specific networks provide a pretty good coverage so I'm not too worried about that.",boston,https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/t8exa4/help_picking_an_ev/,3/7/2022 2:30,0,28,massachusetts

Why don't we start shaming homeless people too, poking fun at the ramshackle tents they live in or the hilarious mental illnesses that afflict them? That would be great fun!

**Schools**

In Buffalo proper, you have three main options for schools:

* Buffalo Public Schools - This is the second largest district in New York. There are many struggling schools with poor graduation rates, but also some of the best schools in the state like City Honors. While many people here will say to avoid city schools altogether, as long as you're willing to put in the extra legwork to ensure your children get into the high performing schools, they will have a great education. Being such a large district Buffalo also offers specialty schools for art, science, technology, vocational studies and Da Vinci allows high school students to take free college classes at D’Youville - resources no suburban district can match.
* Charter Schools
* Private Schools - Mostly Catholic Institutions

**FREE COLLEGE** - Students who live and attend a public or charter school within the City of Buffalo likely qualify for the [Say Yes to Education](https://sayyesbuffalo.org/) program which will send them to any SUNY/CUNY college with tuition paid for in-part or in-full.

**Suburbs** - People will fight over which suburban school district is better, but in reality, even the worst of the bunch is pretty good. New York actually spends the most per student in the nation and the public school quality shows.

[List of Best School Districts](https://www.niche.com/k12/search/best-school-districts/m/buffalo-metro-area/)

**Free SUNY Tuition**

After establishing residency in NYS, most residents qualify to get tuition waived at SUNY institutions ([if meeting specific criteria](https://www.hesc.ny.gov/pay-for-college/financial-aid/types-of-financial-aid/nys-grants-scholarships-awards/the-excelsior-scholarship.html)).

There’s several SUNY Schools in the area:

* University at Buffalo - Top 100 research intensive University
* Buffalo State University - Lower tier college, but offers a large selection of majors. Best know for their teaching program
* SUNY Fredonia - One hour South along the 90. Specializing in music related degrees.
* Erie Community College - offering 3 campuses in Orchard Park, Amherst and Downtown Buffalo
* Niagara Community College
* Genessee Community College
* Jamestown Community College

**Neighborhoods**

The Buffalo-Niagara Metropolitan area is segmented into several areas:

* Buffalo Proper
* South Towns - Southern Suburban Towns and Villages (this area gets more snow)
* North Towns - Northern Suburban Towns, Villages and Cities (much more heavily populated)
* Niagara County - Niagara Falls, Lake Ontario Beaches, Wineries, Old Fort Niagara
* The Southern Tier - Ski country, Alleghany State Park, Resort Towns, Random College Towns and the National Comedy Center
* St Catherines-Niagara - The 400,000 people who live directly across the border. Wineries, restaurants, tacky tourist traps.

**City of Buffalo**

The city of Buffalo is divided up into 4 quadrants with an unofficial ""Central"" area consisting of Downtown, Allentown and Elmwood Village. Each quadrant is then subdivided into neighborhoods, though people often just refer to their quadrant.

* South Buffalo - Anything South of the Buffalo River
* Westside - Anything West of Richmond to the Niagara River. Probably Buffalo's most diverse area with tons of immigrant and refugee groups.
* North Buffalo - Anything North of Delaware Park between Main and Elmwood Ave
* Eastside - Anything East of Main Street, North of the Buffalo River. This is by far the largest quadrant and is a mix of urban prairie, old blue collared neighborhoods, immigrant enclaves, impoverished areas and some pockets of middle class streets.

**Trendy Neighborhoods**

These are all well polished neighborhoods with nice walkable commercial districts.

* Allentown - Just North of Downtown. Gentrified artsy neighborhood by day and crazy nightlife spot by night.
* Elmwood Village - North of Allentown, South of Delaware Park. Lots of college kids from nearby Buff State and Canisius ~~College~~ University, young professionals and families. Lots of events at Bidwell Parkway, easy access to Delaware Park and the Museum District.
* North Buffalo - North of Delaware Park - Less college kids and more young professionals and families. Hertel is probably the best commercial corridor in the entire city.
* Lower Westside - The area directly NW of Downtown, West of Allentown - One of Buffalo's most diverse neighborhoods. Lots of micro commercial districts such as 5 Points, Rhode Island Street, Niagara Street and Connecticut Street.
* Blackrock - North of Buffalo State. Home to the Skajaquada Creek Bike Path and the city's only Wegmans. Also has a number of indie music venues and Chandler Street has become a hub of activity lately.

**Up-and-Coming Neighborhoods**

These are areas rough around the edges, but generally safe. These areas tend to look sketchier than they actually are.

* Downtown - In terms of entertainment, dining and nightlife options, few areas have downtown beat. However, traditionally downtown has been a business district and its only recently that apartments have been built en masse. Therefore, downtown lacks retail options and some of downtown can still be a ghost town outside of the 5-9 work week (if you don't know where to look). Much of downtown is extremely nice, safe and well kept - there are corners that are barren however.  
* Westside - Anything West of Richmond Ave. One of Buffalo's most diverse neighborhoods. While some areas are still rough, stretches of Grant Street and Niagara Street have seen a lot of revitalization, specifically ""Upper Rock"" along Niagara between West Ferry and Forest.
* First Ward - The area SE of Downtown. Look into Riverworks, Barrel Factory, Silo City, the Buffalo Blueway and the old Cooperage. Also, the only neighborhood with convenient access to the Outer Harbor.
* Larkin - 1 Mile East of Downtown. Nearly completely abandoned 20 years ago, Larkin quickly became a secondary business district that also hosts a lot of cool events and is home to several breweries. Today, all the warehouses have been renovated and as more apartments and stores are built, the district is becoming more livable. However, the neighborhood still lacks some basics, but that's not a huge issue if you have a car.
* South Buffalo - Home to Tesla, Caz Park, the Botanic Gardens and soon a Hollywood Movie Studio. South Buffalo has historically been a Irish enclave which is evident with all the neighborhood Irish pubs. Seneca Street has been seeing a lot of attention of late and is budding into a pretty nice commercial district.

**Suburban Walkable Villages**

These are all mostly-walkable historic villages with nice commercial districts. While there are other villages out there, these are the larger ones with the most developed commercial districts.

* Kenmore
* Williamsville - After Elmwood, Williamsville is probably the most in demand area in the region. Mostly for the schools, but also for the events the village puts on every year.
* East Aurora - Home to the Roycroft Inn where the DIY movement was founded as well as Fischer Price and Moog Aerospace
* Hamburg - The largest of the South Town villages with the amenities to match.

**General Tips**

* If you can’t find a certain cuisine type, chances are you’ll find it on the East or Westsides
* Last Call is 4 am
* Some bars don't get busy until after midnight
* Drinking Age is 19 in Ontario
* The Metrorail is FREE to ride downtown above ground. Just hop on and off.
* M&T Friday's - Free entrance to a different museum each Friday
* Food Truck Tuesdays at Larkin - 30+ Food Trucks, Live Music, Outdoor Bar, Great Crowd
* Shakespeare in Delaware Park - Free live Shakespeare plays!
* Nightly Light Show Projected on the Grain Silo Across from Canalside
* Free/Discounted Concert Series - Canalside Concerts, Live at Larkin, Art Park, Bidwell, Cobblestone Live - many villages and towns will have their own concert series too.
* FREE observation deck at the top of Buffalo's gorgeous City Hall.

Same for another SUV which I couldn't identify - no front plate, but NY on the back. Is there some exemption to the law? Or maybe if your car simply doesn't have a space for a front plate holder you're not required to have one?

Putting aside the save-the-planet ideology, it didn't seem like an awesome financial pitch (expensive to do subsequent roof work and the financial return of 12 yrs is basically a 6% annual return along with the risk of your asset living on your roof for 12+ yrs).

Looking back at housing, it seems like buying a house pre-COVID was a good window of opportunity; after Phoenix has led the country in home price inflation, buying a house now sucks.

Could anyone give me some insight on where we are with solar? Basically weighing the projected trajectory of APS electricity inflation vs. any potential solar panel/battery inflation that has already taken place vs. the diminishing returns of government incentives?

&#x200B;

Edit: for anyone who's researching a similar topic, here are a few data points that have come out of my research:

* Cost of solar decreased significantly and then plateaued over the last 10 yrs. Here's a nice breakdown that shows which elements of the installation are rising or dropping over time. [https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2021/documenting-a-decade-of-cost-declines-for-pv-systems.html](https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2021/documenting-a-decade-of-cost-declines-for-pv-systems.html)
* Tesla was the market leader in low solar panel prices over the last few years. Tesla is increasing prices on solar panels (my own data had a 16kW Tesla system for $30,000 in 2020, now priced at $37,000 in 2022). [https://electrek.co/2022/03/14/tesla-increasing-solar-prices-supply-chain-costs-rising/](https://electrek.co/2022/03/14/tesla-increasing-solar-prices-supply-chain-costs-rising/)
* The main tax incentive is a federal tax credit of \~26% of your installation cost. It used to be 30%. For the rest of 2022, it's 26%. For 2023, it's 22%, then after that it's 0. [https://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/1235](https://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/1235)
* Arizona government (ACC) blocked APS from raising rates in 2021. For the interested voters out there, the 3 commissioners that stopped APS from raising rates are Jim O’Connor (R), Anna Tovar (D), and Lea Marquez Peterson (R). The 2 commissioners that tried to help APS raise rates are Justin Olson (R) and Sandra Kennedy (D).

uw2k8o,A2 EV Owners,"Hiya A2 residents,

Does anyone own an EV here, and reside where one doesn't have access to charging from one's place itself? If yes, have you found charging to be an inconvenience? How is the public charging there? I have Googled public charging, and although they are available, they seem to be attached to offices etc, which I don't know if I will have access to or not. I am thinking of getting an EV next, and not looking for a Tesla (I have seen Tesla superchargers right in front of Meijer).

Thanks in advance.

uwezlx,Another complaint about how pointless Solar is if you have SRP,"I just got charged $95 in fees from SRP for my solar.  


I didn't get charged for electric use, I got charged fees.

In fact, I used a total of -805 kwh from SRP  
(-68 on peak, -737 off peak).  


They have their BS monthly service charge of $32.44  
Then they also hit me with a demand charge of $62.47 because my Tesla app screwed up and never swtiched the schedule to May.  So for 1 day my electric was pulling from the grid instead of my backup batteries.  And at some point during any 30 minute period I hit some threshhold of use that made them decide that for using 8kwh within 30 minutes (I made that number up) I get charged $62.  


SRP is so anti-solar yet they hold a monopoly and I feel so hopeless that there is nothing I can do.  


I'm paying $240/month for my solar panels, though I have a little over half the money needed to pay them off in an interest account. At this point I'll just pay them off within the next 3 months because I can't pay 500+ in june or july.  


I'm sorry for making a rant post, but please tell me there is some sort of good news on the horizon. I know SRP recently lost a court case about the monthly service charge, though I'm still being charged that $32 monthly fee so I'm not really sure what's going on with that.   
I really want to see some things change with SRP's greed. Are there any politicians I should be looking into voting for? (as little difference as that will probably make).

Edit:
I will say that overall I spend less money on electric with solar. It will be worth it in the long run, especially with electric costs rising every year.
However if you're stuck in your loan and paying off the interest for the entirety of it, then it might not be as good an idea. Especially with today's interest rates.

Edit edit:
Make sure you get bird deterrents negotiated as part of your install. I wish I had known this ahead of time.
Also some people are reaching out to me, I don't think I can post a referral link to Tesla solar here but you're welcome to message me if you want the referral link for a bit of a discount.",phoenix,https://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/uwezlx/another_complaint_about_how_pointless_solar_is_if/,5/24/2022 0:58,209,201,arizona

Today on my lunch walk on Peet's hill I witnessed a young woman and young man with a dog try to skip out. She stood there cheering ""good boy!"" And clapping while the dog dropped a massive turd and then the two of them walked off down the trail. They only picked it up when I yelled ""thanks for picking up your dog shit!!"" They turned, looked and finally skulked back and picked it up while averting thier gaze. When I got done with work I was packing up my bike and watched another young couple with a bulldog on the linear trail watch thier dog take a long walking shit, and then the guy walked over with a bag, shook it out, looked around and then the two of them walked off. Shame on you all for being such shitty people. I don't believe a single one of you saying you always pick up your poop. I still happen to think you are all....full of shit 🤪

vkiu6k,Ioniq 5 in or near Santa Rosa?,"Hey all!

I have been looking at switching over to an EV since the beginning of the year.  The Ioniq 5 stands out, but unfortunately you can't test drive it at any dealers nearby due to immediately disappearing stock.

If anyone has one, or knows of anyone who does, around the Santa Rosa area, I would be eternally grateful if I could just come look at it, and (if you were comfortable) sit in it. No test drive, I just want to see visibility and comfort! 

I work at a winery, and would be happy to trade a bottle or two for the inconvenience...

w2tjsu,EV owners of /r/Pittsburgh: how does your car handle our hilly terrain in snowy conditions?,"I'm looking to replace my commuter car with an EV sometime in the next year or two, and I'm finding that I'll likely have to make a decision: front wheel drive, rear wheel drive, or all wheel drive?  Plenty of EV models in the size class I'm looking at offer either RWD or AWD, with a very small smattering of FWD options, but AWD is usually an option that adds $3-5k to an EV *while also* cutting the range by 30-60 miles, so I want to make sure that if I spring for it, it's worth it.

A little background on me and how I currently handle our snowy hills in the winter: I currently drive a FWD compact car, and with winter tires on it I find it to be downright impressive in the snow on any hill I encounter throughout my commute.  But FWD and RWD are VERY different beasts in the snow when you're talking ICE cars.  I wonder if the same pattern is found with EVs--they're heavier cars usually, though, so I wouldn't be surprised if RWD layouts do just fine in the snow, anyway, despite not providing power to the steering wheels.

SO!  Here's my request:

**If you drive an EV in the winter around Pittsburgh**, would you be willing to tell me the model, drivetrain layout (FWD, RWD, or AWD), whether you use winter tires or not, and how you assess its competence on a snowy hill?  Even if you don't want to divulge the model, knowing the other information would be really helpful.

I really appreciate any feedback you can give, thanks!",pittsburgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/w2tjsu/ev_owners_of_rpittsburgh_how_does_your_car_handle/,7/19/2022 14:03,45,115,pennsylvania

wig5ui,Why do Detroit politicians and state employees keep on running campaigns on keeping“automotive jobs in Detroit”?,"So many people I talk to that work at an auto company that have a college degrees and are 20-30 years old talk about: 

* how bad the pay is compared to other company’s they could work at 
* how little room for growth there is in them 
* how shitty it is to live near the offices in high cost of living areas (compared to the rest of Michigan) 
* how high of taxes you have to pay if you live in the “center” of auto jobs- Detroit. 
* how corrupt the UAW is. 
* how shitty it is to own a car of the brand of company you work at (especially if you wanna future proof yourself with electric cuz teslas have the best charging infrastructure)
* how working at an auto company is a good “starter job”, but not a good career. 

With all these downsides, it seems like it’d be a better campaign to run on for bringing new industries to Michigan instead of continuing to kick the dead horse of “auto jobs”? I don’t get it.

wjow5x,Just got an almost $60K quote for a 12KW system. Is this as insanely high as I feel it is?,"Had a really great initial experience with an installer company in the area in terms of responsiveness and answering all my questions, but the numbers they came up with seem insanely off compared to everything I've researched.

Maybe I'm just working off old figures or missing something here?...

The proposed system is just shy of 12KW on a tile roof.  No issues or gotchas found in the proposal/estimate.  This is to own, not to lease.  Total cost was $69,500 with a 25 year utility loan at 2%.  That would mean the system cost less interest is nearly $55K.

What has everyone else's experiences been?  I was expecting maybe 1/2 this much in cost which is why I'm a little shocked.  We are fine paying a bit of a premium for a better company/better service, but frankly this feels like gouging.",phoenix,https://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/wjow5x/just_got_an_almost_60k_quote_for_a_12kw_system_is/,8/9/2022 0:26,16,78,arizona

wse2b5,Ditching Second Car,"So I just wanted to write this because many people have said, all my life, that you NEED a car to live in this city. But I think there are ways around it that's not relying on our terrible public transit. I do want to preface what I'm about to say which the fact that my SO does have a car, so our household does have one vehicle.

So I put in an order for my Tesla Model 3 back in November 2021. Fast forward 9 months and my car is set to be delivered at the end of August - beginning of October. Since my lease was up in September, I decided that I would just sell my lease to Algo and make $8k while I wait for my Tesla. I decided to get an electric scooter to get to and from work, which is 4.6 miles away from my condo (from flagami to the grove).

And so far, it's been pretty great. Even considering our weather. I do wear business attire to work, and start at 730 am. I've even thought about cancelling the Tesla order because I love the idea of not having to worry about a car. if I really need to get to work, I'll get an uber and throw the scooter in the trunk and ride home or vice versa (because of bad weather)

I just wanted to make this post to let people know it's possible for SOME people to ditch their cars.",Miami,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/wse2b5/ditching_second_car/,8/19/2022 13:29,18,31,florida

x1vpst,Random Acts Of Kindness Ideas,"A little backstory, as briefly as possible.  I'm a local podcaster/YouTuber, life coach, cult recovery coach, and someone that has been shunned himself by a cult (along with my wife).  I was shunned from Jehovah's Witnesses along with my wife, and I host the Shunned Podcast as well as being the entire subject of the This JW Life podcast.  September 2 of each year is our ""Shunniversary"", this year being our 7th.  I have done little things over the years for it but last year I decided to use my platform to do something bigger.  I went out and did random acts of kindness to connect to the community and encouraged others to do the same.  This year I am doing the same but I'm actually raising funds and putting my own money into the pot as well to go out and try to do something that puts smiles on faces and that is unexpected.

My goal is to do lots of little things more than one big thing with the money I raise.  I will be making a video of it all to try to inspire people in future years with good ideas and to help them see how it really goes.  In the cult I grew up in we were never encouraged to do things like this so it is new for most ex-Jehovah's Witnesses.  Other than knocking on your door to try to save you (you didn't know that you needed it, but we did) we were encouraged to give all of our time and money to the cult, not to connect with our communities in other ways.  For some this may be the first time they've ever given of themselves in this way.

So I've done things like finding people at a thrift store and giving them money to help them buy clothes and such they were needing.  I've surprised people by filling up their car for them at the gas station (that's a lot more expensive now and perhaps too costly for a one time hit unless they drive a Tesla).  I donated money to a school book fair to help kids that couldn't afford to participate to help them be able to get something too.  I've paid for the car behind me in a drive through.  But I need some more ideas, some fun ones too.

Right now I have the following additional ideas, but I have a feeling that you all might know of some specific spots that attract people that might like a helping hand.  Things we take for granted, like a meal or bottle of water, might mean a ton to someone else.  Or maybe people that often feel unappreciated.  Here are my ideas:

Create a basket of goodies for delivery people that deliver to my home, buy candy from a school fundraiser and give it away elsewhere, tip the host or hostess at a restaurant (I imagine that never happens), some sort of care packet for any homeless individuals we might run into along the way but with something that might be fun in it (I'm sure they love food and water, but maybe something that is also purely fun), buy someone's groceries, buy flowers or something and go hand them out in a public place, buy my new neighbor a gift card to a restaurant and something for her pups.

Maybe you have had something that someone did for you that you really appreciated.  Please share it below.  Or maybe you have ideas, maybe you work in some unappreciated industry and would love to see someone there get something unexpected, or maybe you know of an organization that needs help.

In the end it's not like I'm going to be going out with big bucks to help with (maybe hundreds, but not thousands), but I don't know, maybe something you post below gives me a fun idea that would really be meaningful.  Or maybe this post in general inspires someone else to go out and do something.  And it doesn't have to cost money either.  I want to do things that don't cost much or anything that I can also use to give others ideas and inspiration for future years.",Louisville,https://www.reddit.com/r/Louisville/comments/x1vpst/random_acts_of_kindness_ideas/,8/30/2022 21:55,6,9,kentucky

xhfpez,JEA and going solar,"So I'm thinking about getting solar and starting to shop the market but can't really find many references on people's experience with solar installation and JEAs net metering policy.


I had a company called powur  drop me a quote for 16kwh system with 40  hanwah qcell 400 panels, 40 enphase iq8a-72-2 micro inverters  with an estimated 22.2kwh production which will supposedly cover 101% of my electric bill for $49k before the take incentive with an estimated monthly payment of 252 for the next 25 years.


My house( 2100sqft double wide)  chews through roughly 70-90kwh a day depending on if it's laundry day and laundry going all day and the time of the year.

 My electric bill lately over the past 2 months has been right around 350 with JEA but normally. On paper this system looks like it would practically pay for itself but to me this sounds to good to be true especially without a big battery to run the house throughout the night or even on cloudy rainy days.

Edit: last months bill was 363 for electric portion last month. 161 for kWh used, 156 for fuel cost, and the other additional charges like taxes and franchise fee

They do this for maybe 5 minutes, just repeated revving, and then speed off. i’m asleep before it starts so I don’t know if someone drives here and does this or if it’s a neighbor who was already parked out there.

xu7vml,"Grand Rapids, quit taking your anger out on Tesla drivers.","Lived around West Michigan all my life - I know how y'all drive. Ever since wife and I got a Tesla, we noticed people being much more aggressive, and constantly exhibiting behavior that is beyond uncalled for. Tonight was no different. It is to the point that my wife is reconsidering getting a Tesla - she isn't trying to deal with road rage every night. I don't blame her. We're not sure how far people are going to take this kind of behavior. We got kids in the car.

9:12 PM on US-131 southbound at 36th. Traffic is cruising at 80. Semi-truck in center lane. OlderAWD Honda Accord merges into slow lane. I am in passing lane. A new Honda Accord races around to cut in front of us. Clearly engaging in some road rage - speeding in excess of 85MPH, reckless driving, swerving in and out of lanes. All that to slow down and take the 44th street exit. Really classy fella.

4:15 PM on US-131 northbound at Alpine - a lifted truck with wheel spacers is tailing us hard. We're doing 80 and everyone is boxed in with traffic on all sides. But this truck didn't care. They pass us, toss trash out of the window, before we notice a big fuck Biden sticker on the back. Another really classy fella.

Attached is a video of the 9:12 PM incident. The license plate was obtained and since these incidents have become so common in West Michigan, 911 is on speed dial. Since there was no gun or accident involved, police probably won't do anything.

People ask me what is the worst thing about owning a Tesla, and let me tell you, this is the worst thing about owning a Tesla. These problems aren't unique to Tesla, but the frequency of them is. You really have to be that much more aware of the people around you. People think the Tesla is political, *or something,* I can't really explain all the hate. The goal of this post is to raise awareness to a growing problem in West Michigan. Most common issues are;

* cutting in front of the car
* tailgating
* coal rolling
* things thrown at the car
* EV charging stations blocked

Grand Rapids, you better shape up before you kill someone. Tesla's have 8 cameras on them, recording at all times. The cars are watching you, and we're calling the police.

ys1et7,Why the TravelSafely App isn't a good #VisionZero approach,"**TL;DR: The TravelSafely App misses the forest for the trees, doesn't implement actual Vision Zero solutions, has possible ties to General Motors, and is technological worship gone awry**

**What is the new TravelSafely App?**

Recently, Charlotte’s Department of Transportation released a new phone app called [“TravelSafely.”](https://charlottenc.gov/newsroom/cityhighlights/Pages/TravelSafely-App.aspx) The app is supposed to “notify [drivers] when the light is about to turn green,” “warn [drivers] approaching a red light if they are approaching the intersection too fast,” “notify [drivers] if they are traveling too fast in a slow speed zone,” “warn motorists if a cyclist is using the app on the road ahead,” and “notify motorists of pedestrians using the app in the crosswalk … if [the app] detects the motorist is not going to stop.” This app had the backing of Council Member Victoria Watlington who said that “the app is another tool that will help [Charlotte] improve safety for all people using our roads … [during] the South End pilot project.”

On the same day of this announcement, a great new PBS documentary, [The Street Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjseFSvqwBY), was aired by Charlotte DOT’s Vision Zero department and the Charlotte Urban Design Center. This phenomenal film touches on what Vision Zero is ultimately about, the winning strategies to make streets safer, and why this issue is so critical in the face of rising pedestrian deaths, financially struggling municipalities, and climate change.

**What are the concerns with this app and does it address the actual issue of pedestrian fatalities?**

There were a lot of concerns with this app when it first debuted, namely concerns over data rights and privacy, though the city does assure us that “all information shared on the app is anonymous and protected.” That isn’t the concern, however - our concern is that this is targeting the wrong issue, has a possible conflict of interest, and flies against so many rules in good Vision Zero policy work that it ultimately reduces the Vision Zero program to an ineffective meme when it should be a continual push to make all of Charlotte safer.

There are two works I want to point you towards: Walkable City by Jeff Speck and Street Fight: Handbook for an Urban Revolution by Janette Sadik-Khan. When Jeff Speck focused on the key issue of safety in his follow-up work, Walkable City Rules, one of the key issues he focused one was speed of motor vehicles, not driver inattentiveness. “... You are about five times as likely to be killed by a car going 30 as a car going 20, and five times again as likely to be killed by a car going 40.” Janette Sadik-Khan echoed the same issue, citing speed as a critical factor in the rising number of traffic deaths and even tailoring a public awareness campaign to inform motorists of the different impacts on pedestrians that a car going 25 MPH versus 35 MPH can have. So, we would look at this and think, “Let’s just lower the speed limit, right?” Not necessarily - Speck leaves us with a word of caution that “this [speed reduction] cannot be accomplished with speed limits alone … [drivers] drive the speed that is implied by the street design.” When a roadway is too wide with a low speed limit, this often results in the frustrating “speed trap” issue where motorists drive the speed that feels right only to get a costly ticket from a police officer, [which CMPD was happy to do recently.](https://twitter.com/CMPD/status/1588276953265889280) 

While the TravelSafely app does have a feature that indicates to drivers that they are speeding, the bulk of roadway design literature emphasizes time and time again that if you want cars to slow down, you need to change the layout of the street. Not everyone will install an app on their phone and pay attention to it - the number of life-saving implements that a motorist has foregone, such as these amazingly stupid [seat-belt silencers](https://thetikit.com/), is an indicator that a sizeable portion of people simply do not care. Your movement onto a street that is known for routinely maiming and killing pedestrians is not restricted by you having a phone installed - but when the street is designed physically to be safer, it makes that playing field the default for everyone, regardless of whether they’ve installed an app and are actively paying attention to it.

**The conflict of interest: this may be the result of General Motors influence.**


Next, the possible conflict of interest. While The Street Project is a fantastic documentary, take note of who sponsored it - that’s right, General Motors has had a hand in this item and also in sponsoring the film being screened on behalf of Charlotte’s Vision Zero Project. This might not necessarily be newsworthy, except if you dig into GM’s website, you quickly find that GM is espousing that they have the answer to the Vision Zero conundrum: their [Future Roads project](https://futureroads.gm.com/site/us/en/gm-future-roads/home.html), a program that claims to “[use] connected vehicle data to help cities make smarter infrastructure decisions.” The basis of this entire idea isn’t necessarily to detect where the crashes are and to help city workers address these hotspots - this is something that ArcGIS has perfected and that Charlotte DOT and NCDOT have an active and updated database on. No, instead the goal here is to try and create a “smart” system that does what the TravelSafely app is proposed to do. That’s a little funny, isn’t it? That a massive company just happened to sponsor this film and its screening and then the city, on the same day of the screening, reveals this new safety app? 

**The Wonderful Promise of Technology versus Simple, Real Solutions**

One key issue is that oftentimes city officials will see that we can solve these problems with great technical solutions. As Max Brooks once famously said, “Americans worship technology. It’s an inherent trait in the national zeitgeist.” Too often, we let these fantastic promises of our ingenuity and technological prowess coming in to save the day with key issues like [climate change](https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/world-environment-day-can-technology-save-us), [traffic jams](https://ce.berkeley.edu/news/2537), and [having to drive](https://futurism.com/video-elon-musk-promising-self-driving-cars) (with Elon Musk amusingly promising that autonomous vehicles will be ""next year"" since 2014). This often ignores the reality that these technological solutions come at a huge cost and oftentimes can be fixed with simpler solutions. Trying to tackle climate change? Weatherize your home, don't contribute to food waste, walk/bike to work, stop buying stuff, and [push for renewable energy](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/how-you-can-stop-global-warming). Trying to solve traffic jams? Address your zoning so that people can get to work without having to drive, use congestion pricing, and [invest in transit](https://commuterbenefits.com/2020/02/5-ways-to-end-heavy-traffic/). Wanting to invest in autonomous vehicles? Recognize that after [$100 billion invested](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-10-06/even-after-100-billion-self-driving-cars-are-going-nowhere?), it's more cost-efficient to just pay a professional driver. Oftentimes, these innovations come with a staggering cost that we don’t recognize until we think these items through to their full conclusion, a phenomenon that Ben Green examines extensively in The Smart Enough City: Putting Technology in Its Place to Reclaim Our Urban Future. Are we really solving the primary issue by converting all Americans’ cars to electric at the cost of [massive mining operations](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/08/31/biden-electric-vehicles-problems-yergin-507599) and no genuine fix to pedestrian deaths and congestion? Will our roadways become safer for pedestrians if traffic is eliminated by [a tight convoy of autonomous vehicles?](https://www.fastcompany.com/90450754/what-self-driving-cars-will-really-do-to-cities) And does having an autonomous vehicle fix the issue of them hitting and killing pedestrians [currently](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-opens-new-probe-into-fatal-tesla-pedestrian-crash-california-2022-07-07/)?

Lastly, when we look at what other cities are doing with dedicated Vision Zero apps, they are often used as a way for administrative officials to help identify problematic areas and for citizens to log these issues so that they can be addressed before a fatality winds up on the crash map, like what the [City of Boston](https://www.boston.gov/transportation/vision-zero) has done. This is effectively the role that the Charlotte 311+ app should serve, except concerned citizens get routinely [shot down](https://www.reddit.com/r/CLT_Cyclists/comments/yrmy95/update_from_cdot_on_the_eastway_dr_crossing/) when they ask for traffic calming. The city already has the tools and the technical know-how to make our city ultimately safer for motorists, pedestrians, and cyclists alike - we have a number of resources that address how to make our streets safer and not a single one seriously considers incorporating a phone app that is not automatically on every single phone, can be disabled or ignored, or is sponsored by an automobile company. They always stress the need to reduce speeds by physical means, not virtual ones, because it is the physical environment where the battle for safety is lost and won.

**What can I do about all this?**

I urge you all to reach out to the relevant officials and politely voice your concerns with these issues, notably Councilmember Victoria Watlington (who’s email can be found [here](victoria.watlington@charlottenc.gov)) and the Deputy Director of CDOT Justin Carroll (who’s email can be found [here](justin.carroll@charlottenc.gov)).

I get it, they’re super bright and I can understand the confusion & giving me the curiosity “hey your high beams are on flash” but when I flash back to indicate to them that they’re actually not on and this is what the high beams actually look like, why do they keep flashing me or even worse just sit across from me at the light with theirs on now as if I’m refusing to turn mine off? I drive almost exclusively at night and is such a common occurrence.

I just want to get some perspective, are they trying to cancel out my brightness? Or do they just think I’m purposefully trying to blind them?

10af28m,Rehoming fur babies,"Need help rehoming several affectionate kitties. 

Kitty #1: Tessie. Officially named Tesla because she has a Tesla logo on her forehead, this affectionate and playful kitty is about 3 or 4 years old. She is a shorthair torti-tabby, blue and cream. She loves to play and run around and gets along great with other cats. She knows her name and usually comes when called. She is also very fat, which is why I am rehoming her. I cannot control her diet the way she needs because I have too many cats. I am rehoming her for her own health's sake. Spayed, and up to date on shots. 

Kitty #2: Cheddars. Cheddars is an orange tabby Manx, meaning he does not have a tail. He loves belly rubs and sleeping in funny positions. He is very sweet, only slightly playful. He gets along with other cats that are female. We are rehoming him because he is aggressive towards other male cats. He is neutered and up to date on shots. 

Kitty #3 & 4: Bismark and Cattachino. Bismark and Cattachino are the offspring of the above two cats before they got spayed/neutered. They are about 1.5 years old and are currently outside cats, but only because Cheddars will fight them if I let them inside. They are not meant to be outside cats and will beg to be let inside. Cattachino, or Chino for short, is especially needy and affectionate. Bismark is really chill. All they want is to be held, touched, and loved. Both are up to date on shots, including feline leukemia. Bismark is neutered, Chino is not. They are okay around other cats, dogs, and children. Bismark is the blue/gray one with a white spot on his chest, Chino is the cream colored long haired one. Both male. 

Asking $20 rehoming fee for each cat. Would be happy to throw in any cat litter boxes, treats, toys, food, etc needed. They just need to go to good homes.

Intel fabs are being bult in Ohio. New battery plants are going to be built in NY and Nevada. But Illinois gets nothing. This is surprising because Illinois has great infrastructure from railway, to energy grid and nuclear energy sources. An obvious reason could be inept politicians (senators and congresspeople), but could there be more to it?

10zccom,"Krewe of Red Beans founder, Devin De Wulf, robbed of $5,200 cash for parade security, cleanup","Times Pic article:

When Krewe of Red Beans founder Devin De Wulf withdrew $5,200 from his bank account to pay parade-related expenses, he felt nervous walking around with so much cash, fearing he could get robbed.



In the 15 minutes he left the money hidden in his vehicle while he picked his son up from Morris Jeff Community School, that's exactly what happened.

The money was on its way to pay for the deputies and clean-up crews that work during the walking group's Lundi Gras parades. Cash is the customary method of payment, De Wulf said.

Video surveillance from a neighboring business revealed a Tesla or Hyundai with dark-tinted windows pull alongside De Wulf's SUV in the 200 block of South Lopez Street at around 3:10 p.m. Wednesday. An occupant hopped out, smashed the driver's window, grabbed the bank pouch from under the front seat and fled, leaving De Wulf's wallet and laptop untouched.

“I doubt it was random,” De Wulf said.

The entire vehicle burglary took less than a minute, said De Wulf, who believes his vehicle was targeted by thieves who followed him from the Chase Bank on Broad Street. No other vehicles were burglarized. He asked the bank to contact police and provide surveillance footage, but workers there said the bank must first be subpoenaed by police, De Wulf said.

De Wulf called police at 4:11 p.m. and officers were dispatched at 4:53 p.m, according to NOPD logs. Police said late Friday they had no updates on the ongoing investigation and have not identified suspects or made arrests.

Known for its homemade red bean mosaic costumes, the Krewe of Red Beans presents three separate parades: Red Beans, Dead Beans and the Krewe of Feijao. The krewe is also known for its charitable work through the COVID pandemic and Hurricane Ida. The krewe has recently embarked on a $5.9 million project to renovate a large warehouse in Bywater into a multi-use clubhouse called Beanlandia.

The theft now requires that the krewe undergo some belt tightening, like trimming the budget for photography, food and music at this year’s events. In a message to the krewe on Friday, De Wulf suggested that 400-odd krewe members might chip in $10 or $20 to help make ends meet.

The three parades cost approximately $75,000 to produce, De Wulf said, which covers everything, including permits, policing, band music, insurance and litter pickup.

""So,"" De Wulf said, the 5,200 isn't a ""humongous hit.""

""It's not like we have to cancel the parade(s),"" he said. ""But it's still a significant amount of money.""

He's also paying $600 to fix his window, which is tarped for now because glass repair companies were booked up for almost a week, De Wulf said.

However, vehicle burglaries for the week of Jan. 29 to Feb.4—the most recent data available—had dropped 71 percent compared to the same time last year, according to the NOPD Analytics Unit. In 2023, there were 55 vehicle burglaries. In 2022, there were 189 car burglaries.

De Wulf said he’s happy he wasn’t robbed at gunpoint and that his kids witnessed nothing more than broken glass. In the 14 years he has lived in New Orleans, he’s never been robbed before.

""It could have been a lot worse,"" he said.

11556sv,ACE HARDWARE STORE EXPERIENCE ON AUSTIN BLUFFS,"Store is still trash 
Let me start by stating I do not go into Ace hardware but this time because of what i needed i had to. This review is also for most of the ACE hardware stores in Colorado springs and one word to describe them is GARBAGE!!!!!!! I went into this store to cut my car keys just to make sure I have an extra key on hand in case I get locked out. I walked into this store and half way through the store I noticed two store associates just talking and laughing. I approached them to ask for help and immediately one of them walked away while the other one closest to me started 'rearranging' the shelf. So i said excuse me, excuse me, excuse me and then he looked at me from the corner of his eyes with the most condescending look and answered Yes? So at this point I was a little thrown off but I told him what I was here for and he pointed me in the right direction.

Once I approached the hub where they cut keys they person that met me at the counter was the second dude that walked away as I approached them. So I told him what I was there for, now sidenote I have a key blank form another ace hardware store but unfortunately, they only had that one left and the person that cut the key did it so wrong he punched a couple of holes in the key, but I was able to keep just so I can have a reference when I go into other stores. So i showed him the damaged spare key and asked if he had one in the store, without checking, he just said NO. ok i asked can you at least order it. He then looked it up and told me he is not allowed to because the key blank only comes in a set of 5. (no he is not the manager and he did not call anyone to verify).

That was my experience at ACE hardware store a store that is supposed to be helpful. While this review is for one store, all the other store where just as trash. My vehicle is a Hyundai accent and going to a locksmith is not an option because they are trying to charge me $120+ .Oh i also asked if i could bring my own blank(if i am able to but it somewhere else) and how much they would charge. lol he said $40 to cut the key.

11rvlwq,"As Biden pushes electric vehicles, transit advocates feel left behind.","[https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2023/03/14/as-biden-pushes-electric-vehicles-transit-advocates-feel-left-behind/70009599007/](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2023/03/14/as-biden-pushes-electric-vehicles-transit-advocates-feel-left-behind/70009599007/) (Paywalled - text below).

Washington — The U.S. auto industry has received an unprecedented boost under President Joe Biden, a self-described “car guy” who has pushed the federal government to pour billions into electric vehicle production as it aims to combat climate change. That's a point of contention for advocates of livable cities, who say other forms of transportation have been overshadowed by the focus on cars.

President Joe Biden, driving a Ford F-150 Lightning pickup at the automaker's Dearborn Development Center, is being criticized for his administration's intense focus on electric vehicles.

“Electric vehicles are great, but they’re not enough,” said Megan Owens, executive director of Transportation Riders United, a Detroit-based nonprofit that advocates for regional public transit. 

“There’s definitely a frustration that the things that could be more affordable, more equitable, just as good — if not better — for the environment don’t get the attention or investment that the sexy new things and the things that are great for the auto industry get.”

Advocates argue that the unprecedented funding for transportation could have started to loosen U.S. dependence on cars, especially in urban areas, amid a two-year surge in traffic deaths and rising pedestrian and cyclist deaths. 

They also say that switching more transportation to reliable and safe public transit and biking systems would have a bigger impact on emissions, be more accessible to low-income people, and make cities more attractive to talented young people that can contribute to economic growth.

The Biden administration, aided by a narrowly Democratic Congress in 2021 and 2022, has produced a windfall for automakers as the industry invests billions into transitioning from gas- and diesel-powered vehicles to battery-powered ones.

Since the beginning of 2021, Congress and the White House have signed off on $9.2 billion for electric vehicle charging, $7 billion for critical minerals to support EV battery manufacturing, around $12.4 billion in electric vehicle consumer tax credits, $55 billion in tax credits and grants for semiconductor chip production, more than $30.6 billion for electric vehicle battery production, and $110 billion into the highways and bridges that support cars and can be used to expand roads.

By comparison, over the same time frame, they have put $39 billion into public transit, $66 billion for freight and passenger rail, and $5 billion into the new “Safe Streets for All” program, which aims to make roads safer for pedestrians, bikers and drivers. In 2021, the American Society of Civil Engineers estimated there is a $176 billion gap between public transit needs alone and existing funding levels.

Policies that would have supported other ways of getting around also were stripped from the Inflation Reduction Act — Democrats’ social services, environmental and tax law that included more than $360 billion for climate projects — before it passed. 

One such proposal was the E-BIKE Act, sponsored by Rep. Jimmy Panetta, D-California, and co-sponsored by 30 other Democrats in the House (though none from Michigan). The bill would have created a 30% or $1,500 tax credit (whatever is less) to subsidize consumer purchases of electric bikes. It was seen as a companion to the $7,500 tax credit approved for EVs.

The White House did not respond to requests for comment for this story. Alternative transportation funding over the last two years is a significant increase from years past. However, EV investments remain at the center of the administration’s focus and messaging strategy as both a climate fix and a tool to combat China’s economic rise.

“If I go out and buy a Tesla today, I get many thousands of dollars in tax credits. If I go out and buy an electric bike, I get nothing. You can make 100 electric bikes out of the battery of a single Tesla,” said Michael Schneider, founder of Streets for All, which advocates for safer shared-use streets in Los Angeles. “It’s really, really frustrating. And frankly, it comes from the top.”

Concerns about EV safety

Over the course of their lifetimes, including their production and maintenance, electric vehicles already create fewer emissions than gas-powered cars.

But industry experts note that finding the critical minerals needed to build EV batteries introduces new challenges, including the task of ensuring fair labor standards and lowering environmental impacts from mining and extraction.

""Instead of focusing on EVs, we'd like to see the federal, state and local governments focus on how do we get people out of cars altogether and invest in public transit, or build safe places to walk and bike?"" said Jacob DeCastro, communications manager for Transportation Alternatives, a safe streets nonprofit in New York City, where DeCastro says 75% of the public space is dedicated to moving or storing cars.

""Because quite frankly, a future with EVs instead of gas-powered cars still has a lot of the same harms that we're seeing today.""

DeCastro and others cited the risks posed particularly by large SUV and pickup EVs, which have been met with high demand by American consumers, mirroring the market's overwhelming preference for SUVs and trucks over sedans as gas-powered vehicles.

Safety advocates — including the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board — have raised concerns that EVs' comparatively quick acceleration and weight pose new risks.

A Ford F-150 Lightning is up to 3,000 pounds heavier than the non-electric version, and the Mustang Mach-E, Volvo XC40 EV and the Toyota RAV4 EV are all around one-third heavier than their gas-powered counterparts. National crash test programs that determine how safe a car is don't consider the risk to people outside the car, only those inside it.

Biden has regularly appeared in those behemoth electric vehicles during his presidency. The Hummer EV, which Biden test drove during a visit to General Motors Co. in 2021, features a battery that weighs around the same as a Honda Civic. He's also zoomed around a test track in the electric Ford F-150 Lightning.

“There’s a lot of people that look up to the President of the United States and think ‘Oh, this is going to be the solution’” to the growing threat of climate change, Schneider said. We need to “change the narrative that electric cars are going to magically solve everything.”

Funding options

Panetta, the congressman who sponsored the E-BIKE Act, said he plans to reintroduce his plan to subsidize electric bike purchases, which outpaced purchases of electric vehicles in 2021, ""to get more butts out of your car and more butts on bikes.""

""I realize that there are those in Washington, D.C., some of my colleagues, who don't necessarily see it that way,"" he said of his legislation, which was supported by the House but killed by Republicans and some Democrats, including Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, in the Senate. ""But that's not going to stop us from continuing to fight for this type of incentive that will help people enjoy the outdoors, get out of their cars and reduce their carbon output.""

But Panetta's bill is unlikely to gain traction with Republicans who now control the House, including some who are proposing cutting much of the Inflation Reduction Act's climate funding in exchange for raising the debt ceiling. Public transportation funding has also consistently been out of favor with rural Republicans who see little use for supporting a system they view as uniquely urban.

Most of the advocates who spoke with The Detroit News said state and local officials have the biggest potential for change. That's particularly tricky for transit advocates in Detroit, a city built on the success of the automotive industry — and similarly built, at least since the 1930s, primarily to accommodate travel by car. 

David Gifford is a lifelong Metro Detroit resident who lives in Warren and works for an automotive supplier in Livonia. He also manages the blog “Transit Guide: Detroit,” which collects maps and schedules of public transportation in the Detroit area. 

David Gifford lives in Warren and would prefer to take the bus to work in Livonia, but it would take two hours and three buses for him to get there. He runs the blog ""Transit Guide: Detroit.""

He would prefer to take the bus to work, but Livonia is a so-called “opt-out” city, meaning it has chosen not to be connected to the regional bus system, and instead has created its own, more limited transit system. It would take him more than two hours and around three buses to get to work using public transit.

The resulting patchwork of transit options is challenging to navigate, he said, and it’s reflective of the system that funds it — largely requiring local voters to approve millages to support their local bus system. 

Gifford cited Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s plans to take out $3.5 billion in bonds to finance fixes to freeways and, in some places, to widen them, as well as the billions the state Legislature is appropriating for electric vehicle and battery plants in Michigan.

“It’s frustrating when people push back about transit funding, saying we shouldn’t be subsidizing bus riders,” he said. “But then you look and see the subsidization of automotive so heavily.”

121a3cy,SF Theft with an Epic Win,"So less than 24 hours into our Sf to Eureka trip we got tickets to see Alcatraz with our 8 year old. Parked at Pier 33 parking across from pier and saw Alcatraz and had a great time, beautiful day. Came back to the car, thinking ice cream before we headed out and realized the back hatch was smashed in and four of our bags, including all of my sons belongings on the trip, were stolen. We called 311, asked about an officer and they said 2 hours min before one would come.  As I'm on the phone with SFPD a man comes up and says I saw who did this and I took a picture. He texts us the photo, I tell the woman taking my report over the phone and she says you should go to Central Station.

Arrive at Central Station realizing we've lost a lot of stuff. Electronics, my sons meds, our car keys for our car at home, my sons teddy bear, all of his clothes all gone.  I live in Chicago I know not getting hurt is what matters you can replace stuff. I give the report, share the photo of the car, mostly for insurance purposes, and the officer says that there is a chance, however slight, that they toss my stuff and someone finds it and turns it in. All I could think was yeah...sure. 

We replace the car at SFO with a new one, we went to target and replaced my sons clothes and bought him a new stuffed animal which was heart breaking and just as were about to check out the Taraval SFPD station calls. They tell me they had a plain clothes unit out and that the sergeant in that car witnessed them dumping our belonging on the street. They chased them down, arrested them, and we got back every single item that had been taken. Like everything, electronics, his swith keys, meds, the teddy bear. It's the most unbelievable experience, and I honestly was shocked it happened there mid day in such a busy place. Hindsight I should have checked all the bags at the hotel until we were leaving. So I hope this serves as a PSA, don't leave anything in your car, and be real mindful of the ground when you park in a lot. If there's a ton of auto glass on the ground your in a bad spot. I would 100% stay away from that lot, in looking around it was everywhere.

12662mi,"Out of curiosity, I requested a quote for a Tesla solar roof system…..","So I have always wanted solar panels for my house but could never justify the cost, plus how my house is angled, they wouldn’t work on the backside of my house, just on the sides but the solar shingles would work on every side of my roof. 

So I found a company that sells both Tesla solar panels and roof tiles. After they showed up and showed me pictures of how they would look on my house, we started to talk about pricing. First, they recommend having 3 Tesla batteries installed that would last 30-40 minutes in a power failure. But the batteries are 22k EACH. I declined and asked about how much would everything be without the batteries. Are you sitting down, because you need to be sitting down. Ok, you ready…. For a full Tesla solar roof, it would be $260,000!!!!!!! And the approximate yearly savings on my power bill would be 80%, so it would take 26-27 years before it paid its self off.  

So I asked about the solar panels. With them only being able to put them on the sides of my house, they could fit a total of 9 panels and that would save me about 20% on my power bill a year. They where a bit more reasonable priced compared to the shingles but even after the tax credit, they would be close to 14k. 

After doing the maths, those would also take over 25 years to pay themselves off…..  So yea, no solar system for me anytime soon.",shreveport,https://www.reddit.com/r/shreveport/comments/12662mi/out_of_curiosity_i_requested_a_quote_for_a_tesla/,3/30/2023 0:34,18,33,louisiana

I also might check apartments that have garages to hopefully charge there too. If not then I might have to use Tesla superchargers. I heard it’s not much difference if I use superchargers frequently but it has to be a Tesla supercharger or it will break/degrade the Tesla battery.

131da0b,Opinions welcome: Corwin Toyota and my plan...,"So, here's my sad story...

1: My daughter will turn 16 at the end of the school year and we decided to get my wife another car. We went to Corwin and bought a used Tesla Model S for 30k (at the time that was a good but not great price). During the sales part, it mostly went as you would expect. High pressure. This car won't last. Blah blah blah. Didn't matter. We wanted the car and were okay with the price. They did however try to add ooln a Data Dot security system without telling us and sneak it into the bill. When I asked about it they said they couldn't remove it. When I asked where I had a greed, they tried to show me a signed edoc on an ipad. Problem was that it said it was signed that day and I hadn't signed anything yet. Ooops! I called them on forging my signature and the finance guy got a real sad look on his face and then removed it without another word. 

2: Fast forward, this car is for our daughter. So over the 4 months of owning it, we really haven't driven it. It went to Tesla to have some upgrades done to the stereo which took a month and then besides that we didn't receive the title from Corwin for 76 days, so it wasn't registered and we just drove it here and there. Less than 1500 miles. Last week it died. Like, completely died. It was towed to Tesla who evaluated it and said the motor was bad and would be 9k to fix. I went back to Corwin and asked how could this be? They told me they had done their 200 point inspection, etc... In reality, they don't have anyone qualified to evaluate or service this car. They really didn't look into it at all and were happy to resell it and pass their problem on to me. They got really unhappy when I asked if this was common practice for them but the a sales manager (JM) told me verbatim, ""why would we sell a bad car. We'd just take it to auction"". Basically saying, if they know a car is junk, they just neglect to mention it and auction it off to someone else. Awesome!

3: Anyway, they suck and I know they aren't going to do anything for me. I'll live. That said, I work from home and I'm pretty mobile. After I get this car fixed, I'm thinking about making a big poster board with this info and the repair invoice and parking my car in front of their lot and just working from my car for a while. Or maybe I'll just leave the car there and move it every few days. It has cameras all over it so I'll know if they try to mess with it. 

Thoughts? Experiences?

I can handle the lost money. It's not great but there are folks in way worse shape than me. So, I'm not gonna cry about that. However, I don't like the idea of them doing this to others.",ColoradoSprings,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColoradoSprings/comments/131da0b/opinions_welcome_corwin_toyota_and_my_plan/,4/28/2023 1:05,12,64,colorado

134e2ms,Literally five minutes into my first ever trip to San Francisco,"My girlfriend and I came to spend the weekend in Sonoma. We flew into SFO on Friday morning with the intention of spending the day in San Francisco.

We quickly drove by the bison paddock at Golden Gate Park, then headed a few blocks north to get some dim sum from Good Luck Dim Sum near 8th and Clement.

While standing in the line outside of the restaurant (with our car in our line of sight) someone came by and did this. We had some bags in the trunk, but thankfully they didn’t check that. They stole an empty backpack that we planned to load our dim sum into for a picnic in the park.

After filing a police report and driving back to the airport, we immediately cancelled the rest of our plans in the city for the day and drove up to Sonoma.

I wanted to share this as a word of caution for other potential visitors, and to just make this experience known to the SF community. I know this is incredibly common - but I hope something can be done to fix this.

13s2ctq,"Tesla hit school bus today, Chicago Ave and State St","I witnessed a red Tesla SUV hit a school bus on the back left corner this afternoon around 1:40pm - 1:50pm near Chicago Ave and State St (on the McDonald’s side).

The school bus stopped in the bus lane. And a red Tesla drove and hit it when moving to the left lane. The Tesla lost its right side mirror and slowly drove off. And there were at least 6 people witnessed the event as it wasn’t quiet.

Meanwhile, there was one police car parked right across the street (policeman in the car), two other police cars parked less than 100ft from the scene. None of them took any visible actions like chasing or trying to stop the Tesla. The Tesla just drove off casually. And I didn’t take the plate number because I thought the police would stop the Tesla. 

Would someone make me understand:
1. Is it not an offense to hit and run? Especially hitting a school bus?
2. Is there some other ways the police is solving this issue without stopping the Tesla? Like they just pull up the footage and fine the driver?

I’m as confused as some other by passers why none of the police cars made a move. I see them patrol around that area frequently alone Chicago Avenue. Is this not a part of the job? I’m not trying to start a war or be offensive to anyone. If this post offends anyone, I’m sorry in advance!

Edit: One police car was right opposite the street from the incident, a coupe car length away. I can’t confirm if the cops in the car saw/hear the incident themselves.

13ssllh,2 Questions for Tesla owners regarding rebates," 

Hey yall,

Had 2 questions for California residents in regards to incentives/rebates if you got time!

1. Is the CVRP only for newly bought cars? No used cars? We bought the car used so I think were out of luck on this rebate. I heard somewhere they are supposed to be coming out with a rebate for used cars but not sure if anyone can confirm this
2. My question is regarding EV off peak hours rate plan by SDG&E. We have this plan and basically this allows us to charge off peak and save some money, however, what we been doing is instead of charging off peak, we charge during the day since we have a solar home and not charge during off peak hours but instead receive a credit. Now we are wondering 2 things  

   1. Where does this credit go? Does it lower the monthly bill or does it just disappear or something lol
   2. Whats more cost effective, charge during the day and receive credit for not charging off peak vs charge off peak?

Thanks! I know its probably best to contact SDG&E regarding question 2 so that's what will prob do but thought I ask reddit first thanks!",sandiego,https://www.reddit.com/r/sandiego/comments/13ssllh/2_questions_for_tesla_owners_regarding_rebates/,5/27/2023 0:01,0,4,california

Was crushing in the right lane of 376 Saturday night when I hit this monster. It actually bent all 4 of my wheels and destroyed 2 tires. Total repair is going to be $5k-$6k. 

I have the entire indent documented and recorded on dash cam. I talked to a PennDOT inspector who said “they would have never allowed this on a highway” He said it was dangerous and if a low or little car hit that it could cause an accident. 

Do I stand any chance in having the state help with the repair or should I just go through insurance?

During summer, it's probably $80-110 a month. During the winter, could be $120-170. When we have friends and family staying over for a while, we definitely are more generous so we'll see our bills spike to $200 or so.

- Cops on horses, along with the fan favorites, the poop scoopers. They were also the only horses in the parade which I’m surprised is even legal around here. 

- Cops with popsicles. Truly a highlight. 

- Bryan  Station Band. Good to see a local high school band. 

- March Madness marching band. A bunch of lovable adult weirdos. Always a fun show. 

- Lexis color guard group. They were really good. Probably a tie with the popsicles for best “act”. 

- Two sets of drag folks. I think they’re great even if they don’t do much in the parade. The best part is the clutching of pearls and gnashing of teeth by about 40% of the crowd. 

- Some GOP and some Democrat people.  Whatever. 

- A bunch of Corvettes

- A bunch of Teslas, with one electric Kia to boot. 

- News people. WLEX, WKYT, and WTVQ. 

- Lots of Little Miss kind of kids. 

- The #nutmobile

- Some fire trucks

and of course the temperature remaining stable without failure during ""isolated"" interaction with exterior lithium fires from secondary vehicles or catastrophic crashes, which are of course reasonable allowances for ""larger industrial battery systems""

And now we wait! Toyota may save some [https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/04/toyota-claims-battery-breakthrough-electric-cars](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jul/04/toyota-claims-battery-breakthrough-electric-cars) but others meet with a markedly different outcome.

**Response two by**  u/[**sandy\_even\_stranger**](https://www.reddit.com/user/sandy_even_stranger/)**:** 

Ignorance really speeds along those conspiracy theories, doesn't it.

Tesla's getting a lot of biz because a huge amount of funding's coming from DOT and EPA for these buses, and federal money comes with Buy American strings. As it happens, not a lot of EV battery manufacturers in America yet. Will that change? Yes, thanks in part to a lot more funding coming through DOE. It's not because people enjoy buying from Tesla or the Biden admin's a huge fan of Elon.

Your scare quotes are bizarre. That's what these things are called. Battery fires aren't happening because of San Francisco movie EV crashes; they happen because lithium is lithium. The fire isolation engineering's impressively good. What the drivers and depots need in the buses, and I don't know whether they have them or not, is cell monitoring that can alert timely of hotspots developing in the individual cells. The fires don't just erupt instantaneously.

In any case, the problem with lithium-battery buses isn't fires; it's that the batteries have relatively short lifespans, are expensive to replace and expensive (financially, environmentally) to recycle. Still better than CO2 machines, still better than private cars (where we'll see more serious problems with EVs because people won't think about what the voltage coming through the chargers means). Your other choices atm are nuclear-driven hydrogen and legs.

**Post 3:**

My scare quotes denote the emotion of sarcasm. ""Tesla's getting a lot of biz"" because the green revolution is being realized on a policy level (even on the local level of Iowa City) by baby boomer corporate democrats and Tesla fanboys motivated by the idea of not making any difficult choices to address climate change. 

""Impressively good"" fire isolation engineering or hypothetical cell monitoring becomes irrelevant in a slipshod production cycle with a company (and new COO) known for rushed, substandard build practices- much like the repeated issues and deficiencies with Tesla cars, which I am guessing you are blind to since you find me mocking the idea as bizarre, because you are uninformed [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpUIZ32n9nw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpUIZ32n9nw). Suggesting my position is akin to ""magical spontaneous combustion"" is a straw man fallacy (to accompany your appeal to authority fallacy). Suggesting ""my other choices at the moment"" are nuclear-driven hydrogen and legs ignores the very first video I posted in this thread, which you did not watch because you are not debating in good faith, which seems to suggest that you merely posted to stroke your own ego about lithium fire expertise and automatically denounce any disagreements with your personal views as conspiracies, while being too intellectually lazy (or perhaps financially motivated in some regard, or just a fan of criminal negligence?) to entertain any arguments to the contrary. Wouldn't the Toyota article I posted be an alternative since solid state batteries carry much less fire risk? You didn't read that. Wouldn't the lithium ion buses in the first video have good fire isolation engineering, achieving EU approval (and yet are disastrous failures)?

151oymc,Exploring Solar Panel Options: Questions and Considerations for Chicago Suburbs," Hi all,  


I am interested in going solar panel. I am in the Chicago suburbs, and my monthly ComEd bills are around $250 in winter and $360 in summer. My monthly usage is 1730 kWh. I went to tesla.com and got the following quote. My home faces southwest, has no shading, wide open areas, a shingle roof, and a steep slope.  


Questions/Concerns:  


Will going solar actually generate enough power for my usage? Do I still have to rely on ComEd other than the monthly connection fees?  


My roof was installed in 2019 after a hailstorm, so it's still pretty new. Will solar installation increase the risk of roof damage? I've heard stories from others who complain about roof leak issues after solar installation.  


I plan to get at least 1 or 2 Powerwalls. Is this worth it? There are very few outage issues in my area, but my main thought is to use the Powerwall at night so I wouldn't have to rely on the grid.  


Please let me know your thoughts and advice.

15zhe1v,What is it with all the tailgater apologists and enablers on this sub?,"I don’t know what it is about this sub these days but a lot of my fellow Angelenos seem disturbingly proud of your automotive misbehavior. 

It usually goes like this, someone complains about tailgating, or a road rager on the 405 and the comments devolve into a WWE super slam of those who hate tailgaters and those who justify it under “if you don’t like it get out of the fast lane”. 

I’m here to say that it’s not always that cut and dry and make a plea for some more decency to each other. 

So here’s my story. A couple of weeks ago, I was on my way to Marina Del Rey in the slow lane at rush hour matching the speed of traffic (30/50 mph). When along came my road rager, in a black Tesla Model 3 who immediately got 1/18th of an inch off my bumper before trying to swerve around me on the shoulder to get to his exit faster. It was a  while ago, there may have been some brake checking and other near misses too. Keep in mind I wasn’t holding anyone up, this was in traffic with nowhere to go, and no goddamned reason to be such an ass. Edit, I didn’t brake check him, I honked as he barely squeezed by on the shoulder, he swerved in and brake checked me, I could’ve explained that better. 

 That’s just one story, I had a guy tailgate me at 80 mph in the fast lane today in addition to people who speed up and block at the sight of a blinker and a whole encyclopedia of infuriating automotive dickishness. 

I guess the question is this, Why are we so nasty to each other? And why do people defend this asinine behavior?

16b7gyw,Questions about EVs in New Orleans- Evacuation/power outages,"So we're obviously moving in the direction of an EV-dominated future- I'm not necessarily opposed to that but I keep coming back to the question of what would happen during an evacuation. It would seem to me that with lots of people being able to charge at home there will be less readily available charging infrastructure per car (and time is a factor too) compared to how widespread gas stations are. Even along interstates a lot of people are probably going to be taking shorter trips where they drive 30 miles or whatever and make it back home without having to recharge. So how does this work during an evacuation? Are there plans for state-built charging stations along the routes or something? Can EVs hold their charge better than a gas-powered car when there's stop and go traffic?

16bxty5,First Speeding Ticket of My Life Courtesy of Gates Mills Cameras,"I'm generally a safe driver. No tickets, no accidents.

I'd never been in that area before that trip to Squire's Castle and likely will never go back now. 

So, this is a general PSA to avoid Mayfield Rd and Gates Mills. They put this camera in an area where people are just by sheer force of gravity going to go faster.  It's super scummy, and the department seems to be fine for money based on the custom Gates Mills PD Tesla Pursuit vehicle we passed that day. 

I'd be more than grateful if anyone has any tips to resolve this ticket or can recommend a good lawyer.

While the UAW strike rages on at Ford, GM, and Stellantis, here's what Tesla stock is doing

In this article:
There are no striking UAW workers demanding significant pay hikes out front of Tesla's (TSLA) Gigafactories.

And investors appear to be appreciating what that could mean for Tesla's profits.

Tesla stock is up over 7% since the beginning of September, outperforming a 4% rise in Ford (F) and a 1.3% gain for General Motors (GM). The relative outperformance of Tesla's stock versus the big two Detroit names has begun to widen since the UAW strike went into effect four days ago.

Tesla famously doesn't have a unionized workforce, the opposite of its legacy auto-making rivals who are now dealing with a potential catastrophe.

ADVERTISEMENT
Wedbush analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives thinks the legacy players will face years of mounting costs due to pressure from the UAW and as a result, weak profits.


""The big issue for GM and Ford as well as investors is around if anywhere near a ~40% wage increase gets approved/agreed this will be a major headwind on the cost front and ultimately in some way be passed down to the consumer and thru EV prices,"" Ives added. ""The costs of EV vehicles out of Detroit is a major advantage going after mass adoption with any $3k, $5k, $7k, etc. added to the slew of vehicles coming out would results in demand churn in our opinion.""

In other words, it would be fertile ground for Tesla to wrestle away market share with its entry-level Model 3 and other offerings.

With no end in sight to the UAW's calculated strikes at Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis (STLA) amid a push for a 40% pay hike, Wall Street thinks the financial impact to all three is mounting.

Citigroup analyst Itay Michaeli estimates a strike at GM's Wentzville assembly plant through September will zap operating profits this year by $140 million. The analyst sees a similar financial impact on the striking Ford assembly plant in Michigan.

The costs for each could surge if the UAW — under the leadership of vocal auto critic Shawn Fain — widens its strike to more plants. Doing so runs the risk of stunting sales while fixed costs remain bloated, a powerful combination that could aggressively eat through the cash positions of Detroit's Big Three.

16pocib,Tesla almost failing me on my driver's test,"I just got my license today (yay!) and I barely scraped by, with an 80 out of 100 (minimum score). Why, do you ask? Well I can admit I made some mistakes, but not enough to warrant just an 80. I got the paper back of what she made the notes on: I saw at least 3 instances of her saying I wasn't using my brakes enough. I used a tesla and made sure the blind spot camera was off (that's why I failed my last test) and that the brakes were on a ""roll"" option, which is where it keeps going for you, unlike usually where it stops without having to use the brakes. So I use the brakes to stop and make sure I don't crash into the car in front of me. I get back inside, and in her feedback she put emphasis on the braking, and I said ""if I hadn't pressed the brakes, I would have literally just kept going, I used them"", and she looked surprised. All the modifications I made to the settings was literally the most I could do to get the tesla to ""normal"" settings.

In the DMV parking lot, I switched the setting back and drove 10x better. I don't see why the driving test can't be different due to different technology. I use my brake VERY sparingly (only in traffic when people are slamming on their brakes), so why should the requirement say I have to use the brakes more? I can agree with the whole blind spot thing, I can agree with not using autopilot, but the brakes are a different story. Absolutely crazy that teslas have been a thing for (according to google) 2008, but if you wanna go more small, 2016, and drivers tests have changed NOTHING for them. I should not have almost failed and actually failed my first time because of the brakes, a feature I literally cannot turn off

&#x200B;

edit: I know how to use my brakes. Thank you, everybody, for calling me an entitled rich kid for owning a tesla (so that we can save money, btw) and thanks for acting like I'm whining about wanting a free pass. I know how to drive. I know that you slow down when approaching a stopped car. Guess what? I drive ""normal"" cars plenty. They're not that fucking different. I literally had three marks on my test: Going 30 in a 25, ""not looking around enough"", and like five separate marks on braking. Drivers test is fucking stupid tbh

The trains shared the streets with a frenetic scrum of horses, carriages, pedestrians, and eventually cars and trucks, a combustible situation that soon earned both 10th and 11th Avenue the nickname Death Ave. 

There were so many accidents and fatalities that the railroad hired actual cowboys from western cattle ranches who rode in front of the trains waving red flags or lanterns to alert jaywalkers. Today, you're more likely to be hit by a parent in a G-Wagon or a Tesla picking their kid up from Avenues.

Outside the apartment they sit drink and smoke all night and there are often different people there every week. I have a feeling its kinda like a trap house but thats none of my business I just want them to stop parking in our spot or blocking us from entering.

story:
My mom got a new car Corolla earlier this year, I’ve borrowed it a couple of times and I’ve noticed drivers tend to tailgate and flash their lights at me. They’ll aggressively change lanes to try to cut me off. It’s happened 3 times already. 

I own a Kia, it’s a 5 year old car, and I can only recall being flashed once in the course of my 5 year ownership. 

So, what gives? Miami drivers hate Corollas?

We are renting a car for a day to try to sight see and I just wanted to confirm my assumptions are correct here.

The plan is to pickup the car by 7 AM and do this route with just a couple bathroom breaks and lunch. As shown in the screenshot, the idea is to go up I15, across VOF hwy, down 167, across Hoover dam and back to start point. Aiming to be back to Venetian by 4:30 PM for dinner/show.

My research says we would pay a $25 toll for lake mead recreation entrance, and maybe a $10 toll for the VOF hwy, correct?

Renting a Tesla model 3 with 250 mile range, is this risky?

Pack lunch or a cool spot along the way?

Is there a smarter route or different sights to see?

I live in a condominium by sears tower where they have been looking for a vendor but have not yet settled on one (hopefully soon!). In the mean time, I have some questions about charging in the city and would appreciate any advice. 

First, it seems like all chargers nearby are in pay-to-park parking garages. Are there any chargers in the loop or west loop that are free to park? I believe some parking garages are free to park if you’re charging an EV but I’m not sure how to tell which ones are and which ones aren’t. I’ve looked around on ChargePoint and in Tesla navigation but I see nothing that specifies free parking when charging. 
How can I find chargers with free parking in the city? Any recommended spots? 

I’m also assuming that free parking when charging is only available for parking garages with superchargers since level 1 & level 2 charging would take too long. Is this correct?

Lastly, I would appreciate any tips for charging in the city without a home charger or any other generic advice! My plan is to try to find a charger any time I go out since I will be paying for parking anyways. Let me know if this is a good plan and if there’s any other tips I should keep in mind.

17xirgm,Best way to get around town?,"My husband is visiting Bozeman from TX next weekend and we’re wondering what’s the easiest way for him to get to/from the airport and around town?

He was planning to rent a car but his license is expired and appointments to renew were 4 months out (so couldn’t get there before trip). We’re assuming no rental place will let him slide with the expired DL even if he has other documents.

We were thinking Uber but then he read something online that was saying it “may not be active this time of year.”

Got any helpful advice or recommendations?

So, any options out there?

I've looked at the car rental companies, and they don't do FSD, plus the Tesla experience seems to be lobotomized through them.

I'd rather skip Turo, ~~particularly since you can't confirm things like options until after you reserve the car~~.  The other sites I have found either link back to Turo or look sketchy AF.

The state is suing SiriusXM for making it so hard to cancel. The company “trains its agents to keep customers on the phone or in the chat for a lengthy six-part conversation that includes asking a series of questions and then pitching the subscriber as many as five retention offers, all to delay cancellation. When customers decline the offers, agents are trained not to take 'no' for an answer and to keep bombarding customers with questions or offers until they either relent or become frustrated.” It took on average 12 minutes to cancel by phone and 30 minutes to cancel online.

18wgixq,The driveway blocking continues. 2023 is a wrap! Plus stories.,"Let's get the stats out of the way:

Month | Cars Towed | Most tows in a single day
---|---|----|----
June| 10 | 1
July| 20 | 2
August| 23 | 2
September| 18 | 3
October | 13 | 2
November | 9| 2
December | 6| 1
Grand Total | 99

The typical preamble is worth mentioning for the unfamiliar:

If someone blocks your driveway you have to call the SFMTA or create a ticket through their website. You must meet with the officer once they arrive (anywhere between 30 minutes to 2 hours later or never) and open your garage to prove you have access / are the owner. Tow trucks then arrive pretty quickly, 10-20 minutes and have the car gone in 5. All of this is to explain that it isn't exactly speedy to do this so when someone blocks a driveway in SF.  Sadly, it basically means that any residential driveway in SF is basically free 30 minute to 2+ hour parking, but that's not exactly a game of chance you should play as it will cost about $800 to recover your towed vehicle.

I have official obvious SFMTA red curbs and a sign on my garage.  The spots on either side of my driveway are only capable of legally fitting a Smart car.  This is how I get double tows.  The spots are inviting and almost look like a car could fit, but almost nothing actually does.  This is why I call them mirage spots.  People will ignore the red zones and curb cuts on mine and my neighbor's driveways, desperate to make the mirage real.  One car doing this often doesn't necessarily result in an impassible driveway, but add the second car and lose all maneuvering space and the driveway becomes impassible.  Contrary to popular belief cars cannot levitate and fall like a tetris piece between two cars and drive perfectly straight into the garage on most SF streets, especially not on my street.  This is to say nothing of the unambiguous completely full on blocking that frequently takes place as well.

Lengthy preamble aside.  I finish the year with nearly 100 cars towed and here is what I've learned

*  My neighbors warning people is the most effective deterrent.  The neighbors come off as doing a favor to the parker and I'm an anonymous asshole in this exchange. win-win.
*  Cones make people think but they do not deter the most belligerent and sometimes my cones get yeeted random places.
*  Ticketing a sacrificial car that is technically illegally parked (but not truly blocking) acts as an effective warning to other blockers
* Blocking my own driveway is the easiest way to solve this problem, except for coming home.

The last point is why there's been such a large decline.  I will proactively just block my own driveway more often.  I'm still towing people when I come home but I'm not getting blocked from leaving nearly as much.  It's a very dumb solution to a problem that shouldn't exist at this level of frequency.

Which leads me to some new stories:

One afternoon we had just returned home, garage door open, and unloading the family in the garage.  A Jeep rolled up and blocked our driveway.  Breaking my rule of confronting people I calmly pointed out the red curbs and that they were in my driveway and my neighbor's.  The response I got was the most intense middle aged lady rant I've ever received.  ""Fuck you, fuck your wife, You're a fucking Karen bitch"", etc etc. The lady's husband eventually got out of the driver side of the car and thankfully he was much more reasonable than her.  ""Yeah he's right, we're in the red and curbs of both driveways"".  He got back in his car and with his wife still hanging out the passenger window screaming at us, drove away.

Christmas day I come home from spending time with extended family and there's a Tesla blocking my driveway.  Unambiguous, what the hell were you thinking, level of blocking.  Christmas response times for the the SFMTA are really good actually so the car is towed in under an hour.  Many hours later there are two people standing where their car used to be absolutely stunned.  Which is mind boggling to me.  You park and block a driveway, not minor annoying encroaching on the red zones / gray area, but rather half your car is in the driveway and you're stunned?  A neighbor approached them and said, ""Yeah I think you car was towed, I've seen like 4 cars towed from that spot"".  Indeed.

Another little anecdote.  I've mentioned that Smart cars can legally fit in these spots.  Well I towed one....  I even saw them park.  They just abjectly failed at parking so bad that they blocked my driveway rather than fitting in the spot that's basically blessed from the heavens specifically for their vehicle.  There wasn't another car in their way, they just rolled up, failed at parking and went about their day.

Anyways, here's to 2024!  January 1st has yielded two tows already.",sanfrancisco,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/18wgixq/the_driveway_blocking_continues_2023_is_a_wrap/,1/2/2024 4:28,648,268,california

I booked a limo (not an SUV or Tesla) through Presidential Limo for an hour to take me from the Linq to Circa. My question is, will Presidential Limos let me bring my liquor for my consumption into the car?

 If you don't know about Presidential Limo, do you have any related insight into any of the other various limo rental services? 

I have tried getting in touch with them but without any luck. So I am hoping the kind people on here could provide some insight.

1avh367,Spending the Weekends Driving Uber Eats in Kansas City,"Scurrying through the night. That’s how I would describe all the Uber Eats and DoorDash and GrubHub drivers like me. Hats pulled down low, staring at our boss the cell phone willing the cooks at Jack Stack to hurry up with our order. I never even noticed all these people before. I just thought poor people loved getting food to go. I didn’t realize they weren’t eating that food, too poor for even appetizers, that they were running them all across the city for $6 a pop. Spending time and gas and money in the 21st century version of sharecropping. The bold were in shirtsleeves but most of us were dressed in the standard Uber Eats attire- hoodies and track pants and tennis shoes. The first time it snowed I made a fatal mistake of wearing boots and my shins hurt for days, running in and out of restaurants. 


This particular weekend is different because its Presidents Day weekend and I have no work on Monday, so I got a car to force myself to drive all weekend. And not just any rental car, “Tesla or similar” that’s what the description said on Payless Car Rental, the low budget car rental shop at 82nd and Metcalf.. Tesla my ass, there is no way Im getting a Tesla for $86 from Friday afternoon until Monday afternoon. But I took my chance anyway, I’d had pretty good luck with Payless and the worker there was my favorite. He loved hearing my stories about taking his rental cars to Nashville and Austin and the warm waters of Gulf Shore, Alabama. I wasn’t going to any of those places of course, I was using his rental cars to deliver Uber Eats all over Kansas City on those weekends but I could always tell a good story.


The ”or similar” turned out to be a Hyundi Ioniq which was a piece of shit. You could only go for a few hundred miles and then you had to charge it and the charging was actually more expensive than the gasoline. Here we go again I realized, more sharecropping. I had been listening to a book called the Four Winds by Kristiin Hannah where the characters were struggling through the Great Depression working for $2 a day picking cotton in the heat buying over-priced food at the company story until the main character was finally shot and killed and I had never related so hard to a protagonist in my life. Six months ago I was working in finance making $175K a year travelling around the world teaching on the side with plenty of money in my pocket and a bucket list filled with Latin American sights. I had been fired from that job but the judge thought I could still make $120K. Yes, I think I can make that too I said but I don’t, I only make $70K. Too bad he said. Now I am spending my gas money driving milkshakes from Shake Shack all the way south of the city to Bucyrus, Kansas for $9 knowing I was making nothing.


I pulled into Twisted Fresh on College Blvd and the worker berated me for not knowing I needed to wait with the other drivers in the back of the store by the Uber Eats cubby. Lady I don’t even know what Twisted Fresh is I wanted to say. Even if there weren’t a thousand other restaurants in this city I don’t even know what the fuck this restaurant is. Pretzels? Breakfast? I don’t know and I don’t care. I scurry to the back of the restaurant with the other drivers waiting. Fuck this I said and I canceled the order. Six minutes is my maximum time in one store to wait for anything. I learned that a long time ago, no matter what they say its six minutes and Im out of there. Otherwise you get stuck at shit restaurants like the Applebees on Rainbow Blvd that is a study in bad management with someone popping their head out of the kitchen every five minutes telling you, almost ready, just bagging it up now, coming right out. No you aren’t. I wish you could short restaurants like you can short company stocks, I would short the shit out of that Applebees. And Winsteads, how is Winsteads even open anymore they can’t even afford to fix their parking lots. 


I have a couple decent runs where I get some good tips in Shawnee, I forgot how kind the people in Shawnee are. Something about that city I just love. Im not even close to there I just drive up there anyway. You would think people in Leawood would be good tippers but they aren’t. The last time I went there I went to a God damn mansion of a house with Corinthian columns and late model cars in the driveway and they tipped me 79 cents. That’s probably why you don’t know right away what people tip, I want to pelt nickles at their Corinthian columns so bad. The Shawnee people are the best tippers, I just type in First Watch Shawnee and hang out over there, always great deliveries and great tips. That Popeyes is right there though and God damn can I not avoid eating there. I hate spending my Uber money eating, feels like more sharecropping. I curse my weak will as I pull into the drive thru and get the $5.99 chicken wings special. I keep eating at all these restaurants I go to, the ones I can afford anyway. Popeyes and KFC and Taco Bell, all those shit burritos they put potatoes in and sell for $1.29. I don’t even like the food I just need sustenance in my body and I can’t afford anything good. Hell, I can’t even afford McDonalds, last time it was $11 for some burgers and fries and a sweet tea. I don’t know the exact moment I got priced out of McDonalds but it’s was a pretty sobering fact. And heat, I got priced out of heat at my house. My last Atmos Energy bill was $383 which came as a shock. My friend Bea at volleyball beach told me she turns her heat off at night so I thought oh I can do that. But she’s married to a giant oak tree of a man with a shock of red hair, that’s probably making it much warmer. I have two blankets on my bed and a space heater on my nightstand. Its hard to believe my life has come to this, too poor for heat. 


I decide to take a run into downtown but I regretted it right away. Usually I never went east of State Line. That was the only advice Derrick had given me driving for Uber, never go East of State line. They will pull you over there for one good trip and then hit you with a hundred $4 trips and you will lose your money. Plus last time I had taken a few more and somehow ended up all the way up in Platte City, an hour from my home on the south outskirts of town. Plus downtown was where it happened last week and I know my chest will tighten up. I wasn’t even at the rally I was down the street on Main. We watched the parade at 17th and Grand and I wanted to go to the rally but Grant wanted chicken wings so we got in at Streetcar at 17th and Main, lucky to have a table and watch Chiefs players drunkenly slur into microphones on stage. I wonder if they regret that now, they must Im sure. I regret being down there at all. I was supposed to take my kids that day but my ex said she didn’t feel comfortable with them down there. Womens intuition is a strong force, I won’t doubt that force again.  The shootings happened on 23rd and main and we heard in the restaurant active shooters, active shooters but then the restaurant inexplicably turned the station off and turned on classic rock. Of all the times in my life I needed news this was definitely one of them, being only six blocks away from at least two active shooters. I threw the little money I had at Grant and told him I would Venmo if there was more and then I made the horrible mistake of walking up Main Street towards my car. I was parked West of 20th and Main, I knew I had to get there first and then go to Pennway and under the highway to the Tony Aguierre Community Center where my car was. But to get there I had to walk down Main, and everyone coming up Main was running towards me, crying, dragging kids, horrible expressions on all of their faces. What had they seen. I love to help people- if theres a car in the snow, Im one of the guys pushing it. I’ve given away thousands of dollars in food and baby formula on Reddit. Im a helper. But all these people were passing me and I could do nothing, they were all running away from a tragedy and I couldn’t help them. A Hispanic lady had tears and mascara running down her face and a toddler in one arm and she was almost dragging her young daughter behind her. That face has haunted me in my dreams ever since it happened. Im already an insomniac but I haven’t slept through the night since. I stumbled off the curb turning my ankle and hobbled west towards my car cursing my decision not to buy health insurance in case this got worse.



I thought about it all as I drove that way, passing Town Topic on the right. Nope nope nope I said and I canceled another order and got the fuck out of downtown. I needed to charge the electric car anyway and the only place I knew to go was Oak Park Mall. I put in my nearly maxed out credit card into the slot and grimaced as it said an hour and a half to charge. What the fuck, an hour and a half, that was going to kill all my time. I could see the Five Guys sign but I knew there was no way I could afford those fries, I would have to wait until someone ordered those and I could sneak a couple out of the side of the bag, careful to replace the sticker before delivering. I leaned my seat back and turned up the book, City of Thieves relating to their hunger and poverty, my place juxtapositioned against the giant F-150s jockeying for spots at the mall where another shooting had happened months ago but everyone had already forgotten about. I fell asleep to the sounds of my Libby audiobook from the library and awoke to the beeping that my piece of shit Hyundai was done charging. 


By then it was already almost midnight. I took two bumps of cocaine to get myself ready for the late night shift.(Disclaimer its stupid that I have to write this but the last time I was in court they asked are you Ask_me_4_a_story and I said no comment and they said they would assume I am and they brought up my stories these are STORIES you dumb dumbs I've never done these kinds of drugs in my life its not real, Im a writer, and I like putting drugs in my stories, I can't believe I have to put this disclaimer in but here you go)  I felt the drugs coursing through my body as I unhooked the charger and brought the car back to life. My app pinged Papa Johns on 87th so I jammed on the gas at the stop light and rocketed forward. That was the only cool thing about that electric car, you could stamp down on the gas and rocket forward and it felt like the Boomerang ride at Worlds of Fun. I made it to Papa Johns and picked up the pizza and looked at my screen dismayed when it said I had to go all the way out to Kansas City Kansas. Fuck, KCK is deadman's land, there are no restaurants down there so I would be coming back emptyhanded. And that’s when it happened, at that exact moment a lifelong fantasy was playing out right beside me. A Dodge Charger was revving his engine next to me on 87th. Holy shit, I thought, this dumb gearhead doesn’t know I have an electric car. He is revving his engine at me, the universal sign for lets race. My whole life I’ve never won a drag race. This was my chance. Even though it was a piece of shit Hyundai it was electric, it could go 80mph in seconds. 

Fuck yes. I gripped the steering wheel tight and leaned forward, foot ready to accelerated. I looked over to the man in the Charger and I nodded and the light turned green. I slammed my foot down so hard my ankle throbbed and my back shot back into the seat and I rocketed forward. The cold Johnson County streets were empty and desolate and I rocketed through them 80mph laughing and yelling. I pulled over and rolled my window down and when he finally caught up to me I screamed out my window, YOU JUST GOT SMOKED BY A HUNDAI MOTHERFUCKER, YOU JUST GOT SMOKED BY A HYUNDAI! But then what I thought, he drove off confused but don’t I win something? I should get his car right? I racked my brain back to the Fast and Furious movies but I couldn’t remember what happened after the races, just a lot of people talking about family. What a letdown, I thought you got to keep someone’s car. I drove North to the house but they didn’t answer, even with me banging on the door. Usually you just set the order down and take a picture but this one needed a pin number and I don’t know if you’ve ever found yourself late at night in Kansas City Kansas pounding on a door to get a pin number but eventually you just say fuck it and leave it on the porch. 

I took a 7-11 order and then wound my way back to the late night McDonalds on Metcalf where two drunk people were yelling into the speaker. LISTEN! The driver kept yelling, :LISTEN we want burgers AND fries. And LISTEN  we also want milkshakes. You don’t have to say listen you dumbasses, it has microphonic capabilities. When they finally finished and went to the pay window I said my Uber Eats order and quickly went around them to the second window while that drunk motherfucker was still fumbling with his payment. HEY HEY the lady yelled out the window, YOU CANT DO THAT, THIS IS A MICDONALDS, THEY HAVE RULES. LISTEN, LISTEN, he kept yelling from the drivers side, we are going to beat the shit out of you. I doubt it I thought, I’ve got an electric vehicle and cocaine in my veins, Im pretty sure I can take your drunk ass. I flipped them off when they handed me my order and eased back onto Metcalf but to my disbelief those fuckers were chasing me. Chasing me. I haven’t been chased by a car in 20 years. Bring it on motherfucker I yelled out the window into the freezing cold February air. I gunned the engine and shot down the road with my back slamming into the seat and I laughed as they got smaller and smaller in my rearview and then I saw myself, a maniacal grin on my face, the music all the way up, cold air shocking my face, scurrying through the night.",kansascity,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/1avh367/spending_the_weekends_driving_uber_eats_in_kansas/,2/20/2024 13:00,1,2,kansas
1avkesr,A message from an insurance agent in Columbus,"I've seen so many posts on here lately asking about company recommendations since the cost of your insurance is going up. Just thought I would offer a few insights on the auto insurance industry today:

&#x200B;

\-EVERY company has taken rate increases. Most are up at least 20-30+ percent in the last year or two

\-There is no ""best"" company. Every company is 'best' for certain types of drivers/cars that their actuaries deem to be most desirable. Obviously there can be large differences in customer service/claims. This is why it's always better to have an agent

\-There are benefits and drawbacks to independent agents. I've been both captive and independent in the last 10 years and I don't think one is necessarily better. Depends what your specific needs are and they both have benefits/drawbacks

\-These rate increases aren't going away any time soon. Fed report from January alone showed an increase of over 20% in auto insurance

\-The reason for the increases is a little bit of everything. As every part of what makes up auto insurance gets more expensive (medical bills, cost of car parts, increased tech in cars, cost of labor, rental cars, lawyer fees) as does the insurance that covers those things. When I first started a fender bender would be a $1,500 claim to fix a bumper and send people on their way. Now if you rear end a tesla you could be looking at $10,000+ depending on what sensors/cameras/tech needs replaced.

\-Each company has their own way to stop the bleeding. Besides rate increases, you see companies not writing Hyundai's and Kias, only accepting multiple months up front to start a new policies. Looking back now SEVEN years to rate tickets/accidents. Never seen this before

\-Ohio is still one of the cheapest insurance states in the country. Yes it's another cost that is going up and it sucks, but I have people all the time coming from other states with clean record who are paying 350+/month for a single car

Last year, legislation was passed that allows cities to employ civilian personnel to investigate traffic crashes that solely involve property damage. The program will launch this summer with 16 Civilian Crash Investigators working Monday to Friday using a mix of hybrid and fully electric vehicles.
 
In 2022, CMPD Officers spent 31,262 hours responding to 23,992 qualifying crashes during this time frame. The launch of this program and the hiring of Civilian Traffic Investigators will allow officers to continue to focus on proactive crime reduction and responding to emergent calls for service. We would like to thank Charlotte City Council for their continued support and investment in our department.
 
We look forward to sharing additional information in the coming weeks about the launch of this program including job posting announcements, the training required for civilian investigators, uniform design more.",Charlotte,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/1b136ds/cmpd_civilian_crash_investigators/,2/27/2024 4:42,21,18,northcarolina

1b4t9fh,Santa Barbara Embraces Futuristic Transportation with Fleet of Cyber Truck Teslas,"
In a bold move towards a sustainable and innovative future, Santa Barbara has announced plans to revolutionize its transportation infrastructure by introducing a fleet of Cyber Truck Teslas onto its streets. This transformative initiative is set to redefine the city's landscape and elevate the community to new heights.

The decision to adopt Cyber Truck Teslas as the city's primary mode of transportation stems from a commitment to environmental stewardship and cutting-edge technology. These electric vehicles boast unparalleled efficiency and are equipped with state-of-the-art autonomous driving capabilities, promising to reduce carbon emissions and alleviate traffic congestion.

Mayor Randy Rowse expressed his enthusiasm for the project, stating, ""The introduction of Cyber Truck Teslas represents a significant milestone in Santa Barbara's journey towards sustainability. Not only will these vehicles contribute to cleaner air and a healthier environment, but they will also enhance the overall quality of life for our residents.""

The benefits of this initiative extend far beyond environmental considerations. The Cyber Truck Teslas are designed to withstand rugged terrain and adverse weather conditions, making them ideal for traversing the diverse landscapes of Santa Barbara County. Additionally, their innovative design and advanced safety features ensure a comfortable and secure riding experience for passengers of all ages.

Furthermore, the introduction of these cutting-edge vehicles is expected to stimulate economic growth and create new opportunities for local businesses. With the rise of electric vehicle infrastructure, Santa Barbara is poised to become a hub for innovation and technological advancement, attracting investment and talent from around the globe.

Residents have also expressed their excitement about the prospect of embracing this futuristic mode of transportation. Ardie Hernandez, a longtime resident, commented, ""I can't wait to hop into one of those sleek Cyber Trucks and zip around town without worrying about traffic or pollution. It's like something out of a sci-fi movie, and I'm here for it!""

As Santa Barbara prepares to usher in this new era of transportation, anticipation is building throughout the community. With its commitment to sustainability, innovation, and community well-being, the introduction of Cyber Truck Teslas promises to be a transformative and uplifting journey for the city of Santa Barbara.",SantaBarbara,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaBarbara/comments/1b4t9fh/santa_barbara_embraces_futuristic_transportation/,3/2/2024 17:14,0,19,california

Also do you recommend having the wrap place do the design and wraps or we have a custom wrap to give them to do it. Thanks for the help!'

1. How does the Tesla hold up during cold temperatures?
2. I will be commuting up to 2 hours one way. Would the cold impact the battery in terms of mileage range?
3. I see on social media where people's doorknobs are frozen with ice. Does this happen in the area?

1cehnit,Landlord wanting to charge us $75 more in utilities to charge car,"Title says it all. We already pay $3500 in rent and $250 in utilities. We are on a triplex with a fourth ADU unit. My fiance drives a Tesla and our neighbor has a hybrid. At the end of March, our landlord texted both of us that he's upping utilities for car charging. 

My fiance is a math guy and calculated with the current kW we use to charge at the current rate it's $24. We asked our landlord for proof it was costing both us and my neighbor $75 and he said ""the utilities for the whole property have gone up ""about $300"". My fiance said he will not be charging at home and only at work and we won't be paying more than we do unless given the bill to show we are using $75 worth of energy to charge our car. Our neighbor only charges on the weekend. 

Are landlords allowed to do this? Raise utilities with no warning?

(This is my first time renting from someone I don't know and we've only been in LA since August)

Edit: We have not received an updated lease agreement or any electricity usage bill. We were just sent a text. We do not charge at home at this time and are paying our agreed $250. I overall like our landlord, I just want to see the numbers for the $75 as I worry about getting taken advantage of and if we get charged even more down the road if we just start paying it. Looking at the app, if I take off a drive to Las Vegas, where we are super charged there and back, he's only driving 200-300ish miles a month (depending on if he has to be in office for a project). 

Final edit: thanks everyone for the information for LADH, electricity costs, renters rights, and some tips on how to work through this (especially those that were kind!!!) Again, very new to the area and we don't know if it's a temporary or permanent move. But thanks to all the kind people who shared amazing resources for charging and CA tenant information.

1cs98ax,Detroit killed the sedan. We may all live to regret it,"Last week, General Motors announced that it would end production of the Chevrolet Malibu, which the company first introduced in 1964. Although not exactly a head turner (the Malibu was “so uncool, it was cool,” [declared the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/09/style/chevy-malibu-culture-cool.html)), the sedan has become an American fixture, even an icon, appearing in classic films like Say Anything and Pulp Fiction. Over the past 60 years, GM produced some 10 million of them.

With a price starting at a (relatively) affordable $25,100, Malibu sales [exceeded 130,000 vehicles](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2024/02/usa-chevrolet-sales-numbers-figures-results-fourth-quarter-2023-q4/) last year, a 13% annual increase and enough to rank as the #3 Chevy model, behind only the Silverado and the Equinox. Still, that wasn’t enough to keep the car off GM’s chopping block. The company says that the last Malibu will roll out of its Kansas City, KS, factory [this November](https://www.kctv5.com/2024/05/09/fairfax-gm-plant-end-production-chevrolet-malibu-november-facility-transitions-evs/); the plant will then be retooled to produce the new Chevy Bolt, an electric crossover SUV.

With the Malibu’s demise, GM will no [longer sell any sedans](https://abc7.com/post/production-of-chevrolet-malibu-to-end-general-motors-sedan-chevy/14788891/#:~:text=General%20Motors'%20mainstream%20Chevrolet%20brand,Corvette%20in%20the%20United%20States.&text=2024%208%3A35PM-,General%20Motors'%20mainstream%20Chevrolet%20brand%20will%20sell%20only%20trucks%2C%20SUVs,Corvette%20in%20the%20United%20States.) in the U.S. In that regard, it will have plenty of company. Ford [stopped producing sedans](https://fordauthority.com/2018/04/ford-to-prune-its-north-american-car-lineup-axe-the-fiesta-fusion-taurus-and-most-focus-models/) for the U.S. market in 2018. And it was Sergio Marchionne, the former head of Stellantis, who triggered the headlong retreat in 2016 when he declared that [Dodge and Chrysler would stop making sedans](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/mark-phelan/2018/07/25/fca-sergio-marchionne-intellect-daring-reshaped-auto-industry/821915002/). (Tesla, meanwhile, offers two sedans: the Model 3 and Model S.)

[As recently as 2009](https://www.bts.gov/content/new-and-used-passenger-car-sales-and-leases-thousands-vehicles), U.S. passenger cars (including sedans and a plunging number of station wagons) outsold light trucks (SUVs, pickups, and minivans), but today they’re [less then 20% of new car purchases](https://jalopnik.com/trucks-and-suvs-are-now-over-80-percent-of-new-car-sale-1848427797). The death of the Malibu is confirmation, if anyone still needs it, that the Big Three are done building sedans. That decision is bad news for road users, the environment, and budget-conscious consumers—and it may ultimately come around to bite Detroit.

When asked, automakers are quick to blame the sedan’s decline on shifting consumer preferences. Americans simply want bigger cars, the story goes, and there’s some truth to it. Compared to sedans, many SUV and pickup models provide extra cargo space and give the driver more visibility on the highway. In a crash, those inside a heavier car have a better chance of escaping without injury—although the same can’t be said for pedestrians or those in other vehicles. (That discrepancy inspired a headline in The Onion: “[Conscientious SUV Shopper Just Wants Something That Will Kill Family In Other Car In Case Of Accident.](https://www.theonion.com/conscientious-suv-shopper-just-wants-something-that-wil-1844930331)”)

This narrative of the market’s dispassionate invisible hand tossing the sedan aside holds intuitive appeal, but it leaves gaping holes. For one thing, federal policy has, in many ways, ]distorted the car market to favor larger vehicles](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24139147/suvs-trucks-popularity-federal-policy-pollution). [Fuel economy regulations](https://www.transportation.gov/mission/sustainability/corporate-average-fuel-economy-cafe-standards#:~:text=First%20enacted%20by%20Congress%20in,of%20cars%20and%20light%20trucks.), for instance, are more lenient for SUVs and pickups than they are for smaller cars, nudging automakers to produce more of the former and fewer of the latter. Another egregious example: Small business owners such as real estate agents can [save thousands of dollars by writing off the cost of their vehicle](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5476-section-179.html)—but only if it weighs more than 6,000 pounds, a stipulation that effectively excludes sedans entirely.

Carmakers, for their part, powerfully influence consumer demand through billions of dollars spent on advertising. Because SUVs and pickups are [more expensive and profitable](https://www.businessinsider.com/why-americans-are-not-buying-family-sedans-2017-9) than sedans, manufacturers have a clear incentive to tilt buying decisions away from small cars and toward larger ones (which helps explain ad campaigns designed to confer an undeserved green halo on SUVs).

Even those who don’t want a big car [may feel pressure to upsize](https://slate.com/business/2022/11/suv-size-truck-bloat-pedestrian-deaths.html), if only to avoid being at a disadvantage in a crash or when trying to see what lies ahead on the road. Such people find themselves trapped in a [prisoner’s dilemma](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prisoner-dilemma/), preferring that everyone had smaller cars, but resigning themselves to buying an SUV or pickup since others already have them.

For all these reasons, modest-size sedans like the Malibu are disappearing from American streets, supplanted by SUVs and pickups that seem to grow bulkier with every model refresh. (The Chevy Bolts produced at GM’s Kansas plant [will be bigger than](https://www.caranddriver.com/chevrolet/bolt-ev) the previous Bolt model, which was retired last year.) This pattern of ongoing vehicle expansion, a trend I call [car bloat](https://slate.com/business/2023/12/cars-trucks-suv-sales-electric-safety-risk.html), is especially advanced in North America, but it’s visible worldwide. In 2022, SUVs alone comprised [46%](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/as-their-sales-continue-to-rise-suvs-global-co2-emissions-are-nearing-1-billion-tonnes) of global car sales, [up from 20%](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/global-suv-sales-set-another-record-in-2021-setting-back-efforts-to-reduce-emissions) a decade earlier.

From a societal perspective, the decline of the sedan is a disaster. Consider road safety, an area where the U.S. [underperforms compared to the rest of the rich world](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-11-03/why-us-traffic-safety-fell-so-far-behind-other-countries), especially for pedestrians and cyclists (deaths for both recently [hit 40-year highs](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-says-traffic-deaths-fell-slightly-first-nine-months-2022-2023-01-09/)). Larger cars have [bigger blind spots](https://6abc.com/large-suvs-pickup-trucks-frontover-injuries-blind-spots/13530505/#:~:text=Consumer%20Reports%20demonstrates%20dangers%20of,%22frontover%22%20victims%20are%20children.&text=As%20pickup%20trucks%20and%20large,crossover%20SUVs%20dominate%20our%20roadways.), convey more force in a collision, and [tend to strike a person’s torso rather than their legs](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/14/23960624/truck-suv-hood-height-pedestrian-death-report-iihs). They’re also heavier, with propulsion systems that guzzle more gasoline (or electrons) to move, producing more pollution in the process. Their weight also catalyzes the erosion of tires and roads, spewing microscopic particles that can damage [human health](https://www.lung.org/blog/highway-air-pollution-and-your-health#:~:text=Particulate%20matter%20from%20motor%20vehicles,to%20other%20cancers%20as%20well.) as well as [aquatic ecosystems](https://slate.com/technology/2023/11/car-tires-6ppd-pollution-epa.html).

Despite the myriad problems of car bloat, the federal government has taken no steps to restrain it. In the absence of regulations or taxes, carmakers have ample reason to abandon their sedan models in favor of SUVs and trucks. The higher margins of larger cars is especially precious now, as the Big Three scrabble for money to invest in electrification and autonomous technology, as well as to pay for the rising costs of wages and benefits that they [agreed to last fall](https://www.axios.com/2023/10/31/uaw-deal-agreement-labor-explained-pay-benefit) during negotiations with the United Auto Workers.

Realistically, it would be a Herculean task to pivot back toward selling small cars, even if American automakers wanted to. Although adept at selling high-priced, feature-laden SUVs and trucks, they’re far less experienced at the low-margin, high volume business of producing cheaper small cars. That is one reason (though hardly the only one) that [China’s booming market for EVs](https://insideevs.com/features/719015/china-is-ahead-of-west/), including many modest-size and affordable models, is [sowing fear throughout Detroit](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/22/byd-seagull-ev-puts-global-auto-execs-politicians-on-edge.html#:~:text=Autos-,Why%20a%20small%20China%2Dmade%20EV%20has%20global,execs%20and%20politicians%20on%20edge&text=The%20China%2Dbuilt%20BYD%20Seagull,the%20increasingly%20influential%20Chinese%20automaker.)—and in Washington, too.

Where does the shift from sedans toward SUVs and trucks leave everyday Americans? With a strained wallet, for one thing. With its MSRP starting at $25,100 the Malibu has been one of the most affordable U.S.-produced cars, costing barely half as much as the average new vehicle, which [exceeded $47,000 in February](https://fortune.com/2024/02/28/how-expensive-new-used-cars-outlook-forecast/) (the Malibu is also at least a few thousand dollars cheaper than the Bolt that will replace it at the Kansas factory).

Especially when factoring in higher interest rates and [spiking insurance premiums](https://www.npr.org/2024/03/03/1233963377/auto-home-insurance-premiums-costs-natural-disasters-inflation), cars are becoming a financial strain for many Americans. According to the federal Bureau of Transportation Statistics, the average annual, inflation-adjusted cost of owning a vehicle and driving it 15,000 miles hit $12,182 in 2023, an [increase of over 30% in just six years](https://www.bts.gov/content/average-cost-owning-and-operating-automobilea-assuming-15000-vehicle-miles-year).

Over time, the elimination of sedans leaves the Big Three vulnerable if consumer preferences shift away from enormity. “Legacy car companies haven’t done a great job of thinking long term,” said Alex Roy, a cohost of the Autonocast podcast. “Gutting lineups is probably good for manufacturing efficiency, but not having one vehicle in a given product segment is short-sighted.”

Due to sprawled development patterns and woefully underfunded transit, many American families will still want a car even as they become more expensive. But, as I argued previously in Fast Company, a surge in vehicle prices could compel some households to swap a second or third car for a minicar or e-cargo bike that offers limited range, but costs only a fraction as much. Already, golf carts are popping up in places far removed from the retirement and beach communities where they have been a mainstay: [In New Orleans](https://www.axios.com/local/new-orleans/2024/05/08/golf-cart-enforcement-rules-low-speed-vehicles), they’ve become so popular that the city is adopting new ordinances.

1cvvb0i,I had the craziest drive home from the La county fair last and just cannot believe how insane drivers are,"So I get that leaving a fair where thousands of cars are trying to leave at the same time can be a grueling process. But from leaving the fair and out of sgv along the 10 was just unbelievably insane. 

After we left, I felt like everyone on arrow hwy was almost bumper to bumper but going at 45mph. And then on the 10, I got onto the carpool lane and it’s the fastest lane on the hwy. Generally everyone is going 75+ after 11pm if there’s no traffic. But as I’m moving slowly past traffic, in the time span of being in the lane until the 60, two or three cars crept up behind me and got around over double solid lines. I didn’t feel like I had the opportunity to get out of the way legally. Then, a bmw started tailgating and I tried to huff it in my tiny ass spark trying to get to a legal merging lane and saw I was pushing 95 at this point. Like how?! And ofc of the cars who tried desperately getting around, they literally must have been driving at 105mph+

There were numerous instances last night where a couple vehicles cut abruptly over multiple lanes between cars to get somewhere (a Tesla did this twice in the space of a minute), multiple cars almost rear ended me trying to get around. Another truck tried to squeeze in front of me as it entered the freeway. Like literally I was ahead and this truck basically squeezed me out of my lane.

I thought maybe I was driving slow but nearly the entire drive I was averaging 75-85 so Idt I was slowing anyone down. Really, I was driving at the speed of traffic, more or less like the average driver here

I don’t know if I did anything wrong or if people don’t respect Chevy sparks or if I even have had enough driving experience in LA or elsewhere in SoCal to realize this is more normal than I thought. To clarify I have only driven in LA for a couple of years and have not had every driving experience one could have. 

And ig this is somewhat of an off my chest thing. Idk man the drive home last night was insane

1eccanl,"hit and ran in Clifton park ,looking for information and hints","I just had a hit-and-run incident this afternoon at around 4:37 PM at the intersection of Clifton Country Road and Clifton Park Center Road. I was waiting at the traffic light to turn left toward the YMCA when a car hit me from behind and then drove straight along Clifton Park Center Road and ran away when i pull over my car. The car was white (the front look  like tesla model 3, and no front plate, but not sure), the front lamps should be damaged  
  
Please, if you have any information or hints, please let me know ! And if you have a dash cam and happened to be in that area around that time, please help check if you captured any footage of the incident. My car is a blue-grey Mazda.

1ef22tt,Short term rental spots worth staying in?,"A couple years ago I was looking for a relaxation getaway when accidentally found a super nice cabin to spend a few days in, that was perfect for my family (me, wife, 4yo and 6yo) and only about 4h away from Kansas City. It was in a secluded spot surrounded by trees, but was roomy with nice appliances, a pool table, massage chair, hot tub, swimming pool, a playground for the kids and a crazy awesome solarium facing the forest. One of the days on my trip it rained all day and I spent all afternoon in the solarium, sitting on the recliner watching the rain drench the forest. We'd cook our meals from scratch and just hang out as a family. Heck, it had satellite internet and even a Tesla charger. This particular place was on the west margin of Table Rock Lake (opposite from Branson), but we tried to stay as much as possible in the home and relax.

The reason I'm writing this is because I guess the owner realized how unique their property is and is now charging $400/night, which is way beyond what I'd be comfortable paying. So I started to look for alternatives and I simply can't find any, zero. In central and south Missouri, there's a few charming cabins off I-44. I found a nice, charming cabin in Eminence, MO, but no hot tub, pool table, playground or swimming pool. I tried another cabin in Rolla, MO, but again there wasn't a lot to do in it so we spent a big part of the day driving to nearby state parks.

I was able to find other properties with a big list of amenities around Table Rock lake, but these are usually the 6+ bedrooms you'd need to mingle with extended family to afford. I debated the Elms hotel in Excelsior Springs but the wife goes ""no, no way, ghosts, haunted stuff and shit"". STRs sounds more attractive than hotels because of the secludedness, but most of them don't have nice amenities. The Chateau just outside of Branson seemed promising, but the rooms don't have even a kitchenette, so you have to order food or go out to eat every day. I've tried looking in all directions, up to a 4h drive away from KC but not much luck so far.

I've contacted gas station manager to see the footage, maybe I could have seen their license plate so it's easier police to find the burglars and arrest them so they don't break into anyones car anymore. But they told me its company policy that footage will be only shown to SFPD. I've called SFPD non-emergency around 5 times already and every time they told me police officer would come and I've been waiting there for more than 3 hours, no-once showed up.

I've also went to SFPD police station to take police officer with me to see the footage, but they told me to call Police General Work number. I did but then they told me to call non-emergency phone number again. So I'm kinda stuck. Not sure what police officers are up to in this city.

What should I do in this case? I want to get those people arrested, It's not about my stuff they stole or the car they broke, it's about principles and justice.

Has a CyberTruck claimed the life of a moped driver? Very possibly. These large trucks and SUVs are so big they can't easily see smaller, legal road users. The trucks are too big, and the CyberTruck is extra dangerous, given its weird, hard, angular surfaces.

>New Circle Road was shut down for a time Tuesday afternoon as police responded to a crash involving a moped near the intersection with North Broadway. The outer loop of New Circle was shut down at Old Paris Road, and straight lanes on the inner loop were diverted onto Broadway, according to Lexwrecks, the social media account of the Lexington Traffic Management Center. The collision was reported at 2:16 p.m., said Lt. Brandon Helm of the Lexington Police Department. All lanes had reopened before 4 p.m. The operator of the moped was taken to a hospital with life-threatening injuries. A Tesla Cybertruck was also involved in the collision, WKYT reported.

I was trying to turn left across two lanes, at an intersection with poor visibility, and traffic, didn't know I had a chance to go though, because the lazy dumbass wouldn't use his turn signal like a nice person, to let me know that I was free to cross the lane nearer. Queue me waiting another five minutes. 

Sorry for the angry tone, but I also almost got in an accident because of some asshole doing something completely different this morning, perhaps because I actually rely on turn signals and expect others to respect them. I waited until it was the right time to signal/turn into a turning lane at a red, but whoever was behind me didn't and accelerated past me on the right side too early (before the lane opened up), into my blind-spot, and if they hadn't honked, I'd be talking to the cops right now. So many idiots in cars around here. Then I encountered two people who just slowed down to turn right afterwards at greens without signalling. And yeah, I'm still going to slow down, but I didn't expect that I'd have to.

1fcgie8,"""06L: Bringing the ‘L’ in Low Pressure!"" - 06L / Francine Discussion & Megathread","#What is Damp May Never Dry!
**This post has been updated as of 9/11/24 @ 7pm.**

#OH SHIT, FUZZY MADE A STORM MEGATHREAD. OH LAWD, HURRICANE FRANCINE IS HERE!!!

**In order to make it easier and provide current information to individuals, please keep the conversations surrounding the storm to this thread.** We are trying to consolidate the more serious conversations/information to this thread. **This post is automatically set to sort by new. It is highly recommended that you sort comments by new given the changing environment.** 

For the time being, memes and funny-ish posts can be standalone posts. This is subject to change depending on how the situation evolves. Despite all the humor surrounding it, please take this event seriously and make plans based upon your needs.

Below is some general information/advice, but should not be taken as official recommendations. **Please listen to the local/national authorities in determining your next course of actions.** I will try to update this post with current information when I can. 

Once the storm gets closer to landfall, we will switch from this standalone post to the /r/TropicalWeather live thread as it's a great resource to get up to date information on the storm.

P.S. If you believe something should be appended/amended to this post, please let me know and I'll be happy to consider it.

#What is happening? 

#FRANCINE IS HERE. STAY INDOORS. 

Hurricane Francine is a Category 2 storm that made landfall just south of Houma. The eye currently passing over Houma, LA and is expected to continue on a North-Northeast track over the next 12 hours. The eye wall is just to the West/Southwest of New Orleans. Please exercise extreme caution. Stay in your place of shelter until the storm has passed.

#I'm a weather junky and I need my fix, what do you recommend?

Again, please take advice of your local and national government when making decisions. However, like you, we like knowing what the Euro, GFS, UKMET, HMON, HWRF, COAMPS and Navy models are all doing at all times. For these people:

* [/r/TropicalWeather](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/) - Your favorite tropics subreddit!
* [Tropical Tidbits](https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/) - Levi Cowan is providing some of the best analysis on storms out there. Please consider donating to his patreon. 
* [Hurricane Watch Net](https://www.hwn.org/) - Amateur Radio Operators trained to provide emergency information when stuff goes HAM.
* [Mike's Weather Page](https://spaghettimodels.com/) - If you like seeing a website designed in the early 2000s with a bunch of hurricane graphics on one page, this is the spot for you.
* [NBC 15 Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJc7is6F67EepYaJjxTxtrg) - Mobile is part of the Swampborn Krewe and they have Alan Sealls on the team, arguably one of the best Hurricane Meteorologists the South has. Highly recommend watching his daily videos (they get posted on /r/tropicalweather). 
* [Tropicwx.com](http://tropicwx.com/index.html) - Made by redditor /u/Tweetystraw, similar to Mike's Weather Page, it's an aggregated dashboard of all the things. 
* [Yale Climate Connections](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/topic/eye-on-the-storm/) - Weather Underground used to maintain one of the best blogs called Category 6, after being bought by the Weather Channel, they shut it down. Jeff Masters has moved to the Yale Climate Connections being posted under ""Eye on the Storm."" 
* **New for 2024:** [The r/NewOrleans Discord](https://discord.gg/qGFnEsRY) - Join the discussion in the weather channel!
Another few resources to use. A lot of these use and show the same data, but they all have different uses for me.
* [HurricaneTracker](https://www.hurricanetracker.net/hurricane-tracking-console) -  Shows tropical cyclone information as well as pressure systems, steering winds, wind sheer maps, etc.
* [CyclonicWX](https://cyclonicwx.com) - Has a little more analysis like sea surface temps and some GFS model aggregation. It also has links at the top where you can dive into the raw model data similar to tropical tidbits.
* [Tomer Burg's site](http://arctic.som.ou.edu/tburg/products/realtime/tropical/) - Has the raw model guidance data, but aggregates multiple models into one multi-model which is nice to look at.

#Cat 3 then flee, otherwise I'm staying.

Cool. Good For You! Some people aren't so lucky and can't afford to stay. However, here's some general advice for those of us who are new to those whole hurricane thing:

* **Expect your power to go out.** Depending on the storm severity, expect your power to go out for a week to two weeks in September (Maybe Sweater Weather). Remember, we may have had a weekend of cool weather, but that doesn't mean F A L S E F A L L can't hurt you. 
* **Expect it to flood.** If you're expecting the SWBNO to do their job, I have a bridge to sell you. Move your cars to the neutral ground or a high spot. 
* **Fill up your gas tanks.** Or charge your electric car. Doesn't matter, just make sure you can leave if you need to. 
* **Stock up on your essentials.** Do this now. Do not wait. Cosmic Brownies will sell out.
* **Do your laundry.** I'm not your mother, but your washer and dryer don't work when the power is out. You're gonna regret it if you don't have clean clothes after cleaning up the yard in the heat. 
* **Do your dishes.** MOM, GET OFF REDDIT! But really, same as above. Dishwasher don't work in a power outage. You're gonna want clean dishes. 
* **Mow ya' lawn.** NOW DAD IS ASKING ME TO DO YARD WORK?! Yeah, trust me. Mow your yard before the storm. It's Louisiana Storm Prep!
* **Get cash from the ATM.** What? You think credit cards and apple pay works during a power outage? Nope! Prepare to go analog and get some cold hard cash from the ATM. When you need to go to Schwegmann's to get some rice and beans, you'll be able to pay. 
* **Get you and your pets medicines.** This is often overlooked. If you have essential medical needs, get your refills now (this includes the good bois and cool cats and kittens).
* **Fill up your bathtub the night before.** Boil advisories are expected and you will need water to flush the toilets. 
* **Put bottled water in the freezer.** Trust me on this one, fill your freezer to the MAX with water bottles. It will keep your freezer colder for longer and you'll have cool water during an extended power outage. Also, keep your fridge and freezer closed for as long as you can.
* **Charge your spare batteries.** If you have external rechargeable batteries for your phones, charge them up now. This includes laptops as well - you can charge your phone with a laptop! 
* **Turn around, don't drown.** Do not be a dumbass and drive through high water. I don't care if your Tesla can float or if your F150 is lifted for her pleasure. Don't drive through high water.

#What should I buy?

[/r/TropicalWeather has a fantastic mega-thread on this that we are stealing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TropicalWeather/comments/bvdivw/2019_hurricane_supplies_megathread/) We highly recommend visiting this link and making sure that you have all of these things in your household.

Playing it safe? Can't go wrong with that. Here's some tips/resources for you.

* [LA DOTD Evacuation Map Application](http://gisweb.dotd.la.gov/evacuationroute/desktop.html) - Enter your zip and get a map of how to evacuate. 
* [LA GOHSEP Before & After Hurricane Evacuation Guide](https://gohsep.la.gov/about/louisiana-hazards-plus-threats/hurricanes/before-plus-after-hurricane/) - Mouthful to say, Governor's Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Preparedness or GOHSEP has a great guide on before and after hurricane evacuations.

#What about public transportation? Will it still be operational?

While a lot of people don't have reliable alternative transportation, always make sure you have a plan. In general, you shouldn't expect public transport to operate during a hurricane. Don't rely upon it. Make plans to move to a safe location or a shelter/evacuation center *prior to the storm.* 

Should you need evacuation notices and/or assistance, please review the [New Orleans Regional Transit Authority's website](https://www.norta.com/ride-with-us/changes-that-may-affect-your-ride/hurricane-preparedness) for further information on public transportation and and out of the city in the event of a mandatory evacuation.

Update as of 9/10/24 from RTA: 

>* The Algiers Ferry service is suspended until further notice.
>* All RTA service will be suspended at 3 PM, Sept. 11, 2024.

I wanna say thank you to the strangers who stayed behind me with their 4-ways on to make sure that I made it to the emergency pull-off safely, you really saved me from being rear-ended on top of having a flat, and thank you for being so safety minded and understanding. Also the AAA guy was awesome, thanks for sticking with me.

But more importantly, there was a Tesla who pulled off shortly after me with a very strong burnt rubber smell as well (I didn't see any visual damage, but I'm curious if they had a flat as well). I thought I might have picked up something in the college parking lot, but I'm not 100% sure, and I'm considering the option that there might have been debris ahead of or inside of the Ft Pitt Tunnel heading east.

If you drove through the Ft Pitt Tunnel on the night of September 17th heading east, did you encounter any debris on the roadway or tire issues? And if you're driving eastbound through the tunnels tomorrow morning or later tonight, make sure to drive cautiously inside of and after the tunnel.

I had some plastic parts (that were falling off) repaired recently at a Tesla Service Center, but the car has a heavy smell of mold ever since getting it back (didn't realize the trunk was full of water for few weeks until the Service Center inspection). I think the car may be growing mold internally (potential biohazard) & has unknown issues here and there.

  
I spoke with my insurance company and they told me to go to a repair facility to get an estimate, so they can determine if they can declare it as a total loss.

Tesla Service Centers have huge delays/backlogs & I'm not sure if they even perform flood damage inspection (they just offered a battery pack diagnosis & left the car with water in the trunk for few weeks in my last appointment).

Does anyone have experience claiming total loss from water/flood damage & have auto repair shop recommendations in Jersey City?",jerseycity,https://www.reddit.com/r/jerseycity/comments/1fk72db/where_to_go_for_flood_damagetotal_loss_for_my_car/,9/18/2024 23:41,0,0,newjersey

I looked online and found a decent amount of bad reviews for this dealership but mostly it seemed to be around people who live out of state and were upset with some issue around the delivery of the car, or people upset about something that happened at the dealer and not an issue with the car itself.

There are some other red flags I've noticed in their online postings but im not sure whether its down to the dealer / salesman being lazy, or if this place falsely advertises and tries to pull shady stuff.

1fri3v9,"I am from the future, here’s a news article about Columbus Drivers","**Columbus Drivers So Bad at Driving, City Expands Highways, Enforces Self-Driving Cars—Yet They Still Find Ways to Crash**

**COLUMBUS, OH**—In a desperate attempt to combat the city’s abysmal driving conditions, officials in Columbus have introduced a sweeping range of new measures, from expanding highway lanes to mandating self-driving cars and increasing safety features. Yet, in an outcome baffling engineers and safety experts alike, drivers in the city are still finding innovative new ways to crash their vehicles.

“We’ve thrown everything at the problem—wider roads, AI-controlled vehicles, even speed limits so low pedestrians are passing cars—and nothing seems to stop the accidents,” said Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) spokesperson Diane Briggs. “If there’s one thing Columbus drivers are skilled at, it’s finding new and unexpected ways to wreck their cars.”

The most recent push to improve Columbus’s traffic situation began after the city was ranked *worst in Ohio* for vehicular incidents for the fifth year in a row. In response, officials expanded the notoriously congested I-270 Outerbelt to a staggering 12 lanes. The theory was that more room to maneuver would reduce the number of fender benders, side swipes, and full-blown pile-ups that have plagued local commuters.

Unfortunately, the wider lanes only seemed to inspire even more reckless behavior. 

“I was driving in the middle lane, and suddenly this guy in a Honda Civic next to me decides to merge *across six lanes at once*,” said local driver Jeff Watson, still shaken by the experience. “It’s like people don’t even know how to use their mirrors. The only thing that stopped him from hitting me was his car running out of gas halfway through the maneuver.”

Next, the city mandated that all new vehicles sold in Columbus must be equipped with self-driving technology, hoping AI could do what human drivers clearly couldn’t: prevent crashes. Within weeks, however, local motorists found a way to thwart even that plan.

“I was cruising down 315 in my Tesla on autopilot when I noticed the car in front of me—a self-driving Nissan—just swerving back and forth, like it was confused,” explained Emily Norton, another local resident. “I pulled up next to it, and there was this guy in the passenger seat, *eating a sandwich while watching TikTok*. He wasn’t even in the driver’s seat!”

Norton isn’t alone in her experience. In the first month of the self-driving mandate, Columbus saw a 30% increase in accidents, most of them caused by drivers climbing into the backseat or straight-up abandoning the wheel altogether. “People are treating their cars like Ubers,” Norton added. “And when the AI gets confused by four cars trying to cut across traffic at the same time, well, you get a 12-car pileup.”

In a final effort to mitigate Columbus’s traffic disasters, ODOT installed an unprecedented number of safety features: rumble strips, automated braking systems, lane departure warnings, and even large foam padding on concrete barriers. Yet drivers continued to defy the laws of both safety and common sense.

One recent crash, which occurred on I-71, involved a minivan attempting to drive through a freshly painted lane divider as if it were an actual lane. “He just went for it,” said one witness. “Full speed, like he thought the lines didn’t apply to him. The van bounced between the foam barriers like a pinball before finally flipping over.”

Columbus police officers, who have seen it all, are equally flummoxed by the situation. ""I once responded to a crash where a guy somehow managed to rear-end a parked car while exiting a McDonald's drive-thru,"" said Officer Jake Morrison. ""At this point, if I showed up to a scene and found a car stuck in a tree, I wouldn't even be surprised anymore.""

Despite the chaos, many locals are simply resigned to the reality of Columbus driving. “We’ve tried everything, but nothing seems to work,” said Briggs. “We’re now at the point where we’re just asking people to *please* at least use their turn signals. But even that’s probably a long shot.”

At press time, officials were reportedly considering a plan to ban all drivers from Columbus highways and replace them with an elaborate system of conveyor belts. However, skeptics predict that even then, someone will still find a way to crash into the machinery.",Columbus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/1fri3v9/i_am_from_the_future_heres_a_news_article_about/,9/28/2024 16:27,0,2,ohio

1fs7o1f,Had the most terrifying Uber experience on Friday evening,"Around 6pm we were picked up by an older gentleman in a white Tesla Uber. My boyfriend and I said our hellos, and then we were chatting and singing in the back (quietly) as we were on our way to West Gate for a concert. I mentioned I thought the I10 was closed, and went on my phone to check. The Uber driver said “is the I10 closed? I don’t know these roads I’m not from here.” I googled and found the 10 closes at midnight. That was our only interaction with the driver. Moments later we are getting on the on ramp for the 10, the driver looks in his rear view mirror and screams “don’t f*** with me m*****f******  I’ll f*** you up!” My boyfriend, confused, looks behind him and says “oh is someone tailgating you?” The driver says “no I’m talking to you mf****..” and keeps going yelling and threatening us, saying things like he will fight my boyfriend, you think you’re tough...and my boyfriend and I had literally just been chatting to each other about the concert and the traffic. We were absolutely scared, my boyfriend apologized and asked what he had done, what he had said, saying I’m so sorry I won’t say anything… once the Uber driver wouldn’t make any sense of if my boyfriend said anything offensive or literally anything, I realized this man was having a mental health episode. Then, the Uber driver starts driving erratic, weaving in and out of traffic. I started to worry that he was going to make us get out of the car on the i10, and it was dark out. I start shaking and trying to take deep breaths. He is still cursing, angry and absolutely losing his mind. I say calmly “sir can you please take the next exit” I can’t even finish my sentence and he says “don’t start with me woman!!” Luckily, we make it to 7th street and he quickly pulls into a McDonalds. I walk quickly inside, scared for my safety. I call Uber safety reporting line and report the incident. We were extremely shaken up, but more worried about what if he picks up another passenger right now? 
It was one of the most terrifying experiences. This man flipped a switch on us. We are still very shaken up and upset from the experience. ",phoenix,https://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/1fs7o1f/had_the_most_terrifying_uber_experience_on_friday/,9/29/2024 15:59,1235,257,arizona

1fw594m,I Wrote a Wild New Superspy Series based on the Hilltop's Top-Secret Early History ,"In 2016, I outlined five action-packed fictional superspy novels based on the wild, top-secret years of Sullivant's Hill (today’s Hilltop, 1861-1917), then started writing. 

I had been uncovering wild things about this hill since 1985. 

https://preview.redd.it/s34u2gajxrsd1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0ec865d843c0f478be38b10ce34b80a6461f559

  
I call the series The Spies from Sullivant's Hill. The first novel, The Southern Cross, was released Monday on [Amazon Kindle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DJ3JV2C3) for $5.99. 

However, until Christmas,  
it's Free to download from the homepage of [UpperColumbus.com](http://uppercolumbus.com). 

I envisioned each book as  
one season of a thrilling TV series and each episode (chapter) a cliffhanger.  
  
The Southern Cross, the first novel released, has ten Episodes (PDF chapters). Episodes 1-5 were posted today at UpperColumbus.com. I will post another episode each Friday until the conclusion on November 8. All ten episodes (the entire novel) will remain posted through Christmas.

What is the Southern Cross all about?

Soon after the Civil War, three Ohio-born and raised US Presidents in a row (Grant, Hayes, and Garfield) hid most of our country's top-secret facilities along a lonely route they called the “Railroad to Nowhere,"" which ran across Sullivant’s Hill (today’s Hilltop). The massive security force from the frightening Hilltop Lunatic Asylum, the nation's largest building, guarded these secret projects.

The Spies of Sullivant's Hill is a clever, rapid-fire, gadget-packed, often comical superspy series based on one of these secret operations, likely code-named ORPHAN. According to one of the first stories I heard in 1985, ORPHAN was our country’s first clandestine espionage agency. It was headquartered inside an underground  
fortress near the hill's crest, originally a hidden weapon factory built during the Civil War.

The first novel in this series is called The Southern Cross. It introduces ORPHAN's first superspies:  
eccentric entertainer Colin McLaughlin and the badass gourmet Lemont Freeman,  
who happens to be Aunt Jemima's larger-than-life son.  
  
In The Southern Cross, Freeman and Mclaughlin take on the planet's most self-absorbed madman, Southern tycoon Tyberious Maximus Cross. ​  
​​​​  
At fourteen, Cross inherited his family's international shipping empire; 25 years later (1882), his henchmen stole 17 notebooks from the newly arrived Nicola Tesla. By 1885, Cross’s engineers and slaves at his hidden industrial complexes in Cuba had turned Nicky's notes into a vast arsenal of Earth's first radio wave-ignited weapons. ​​  
​  
On May 1, 1885, Cross's new Confederacy was set to win the Civil War almost instantly, 20 years after the first Confederacy lost it.​  
​  
However, after being looted, Nicola Tesla became ORPHAN'S Tech Master, cranking out wild weapons, spy gadgets, and insane speed machines to hopefully help McLaughlin and Freeman save America from that  
Southerner named Cross.  
​  
Not only can you download all ten episodes at [UpperColumbus.com](http://UpperColumbus.com) for FREE, but the website also has five pages with hundreds of never-before-reported facts and images that expose the top-secret history of Sullivant’s Hill. Wise has been compiling this since the mid-1980s.

We had a great sales rep and our finance person (the person they send you to to sign everything?) were both great. My car, a 2022 Tesla Model 3, with about 44k miles on it had a trunk issue that was under warranty and needed fixed from Tesla. They told me, take it to Tesla, if they can't fix it we will do what we can here, no charge to you. I sign and finance the car (Aug. 9th) and then submit a request for service with Tesla on Aug. 17th. In my request, I also said, it feels like the car pulls to the right - can you look at the alignment? The soonest I could get in with Tesla was Oct 1st.

Oct 1st comes, I drop my car off with Tesla, soon I get a message saying that there are underlying issues with its steering due to impact damage. Their estimate starts off at $1.9k. I call Drive Direct looking for some sort of assistance with this issue. I told them I understand that covering all of this is probably a leap but something to help with these repairs would mean a lot. We bought not one, but two cars from them within days of each other because we liked their staff. They tell me that basically I've had the car ""for a long time"" and they don't know if I cause the damage with a pot hole or something within the two months that I've had the car. I told them I have documented proof that I noticed this issue within a week of having the car when I requested service with Tesla. Also, that they sell the cars ""as is"", but I argued that a reasonable person is not going to expect to buy a car that still needs thousands of dollars in repairs. I share screenshots with them proving the dates as well as the estimate Tesla sent. I was then told the best they can do is $500 to help with the inconvenience, which I'm still waiting on.

I tell Tesla to go ahead with the repairs as it feels like I'm just screwed and had the worst luck in picking out a used car because its nothing inherent to the car itself, the CarFax was clean and it was bought back in early August. As the week progressed, the estimate continues to go up higher and higher. Their repair estimate is now at about $6k, for a car that I paid about $25k for.

I still feel like this should have been disclosed or there is something that Drive Direct should have seen before selling the car.

Do I have any sort of options or am I really just truly screwed?

For reference, the $6k in repairs, about $2.3k is in 'Steering Gear Assembly', $2.1k for 3x Wheels 'Stiletto 19x8 ($700 per), and about $900 in labor. The rest is in smaller parts.

Frustrated, I got off and ran to Warren St to grab a Citi Bike. I biked all the way to the Holland Tunnel, but just after paying the toll, Port Authority cops stopped me and turned me around. I ditched the bike and ran to Hertz at Newport Mall, where I rented a Tesla. They handed me a parking receipt, but it turned out to be unpaid—I had to shell out $186.23 just to leave the garage. At that point, I was done. I decided I wasn’t going to Brooklyn anymore, so I opened Resy and booked a table for dinner at Domo Domo instead.

The City of Columbus, the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA), and the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC), as some would argue, are making a $6 billion dollar bet on the LinkUS November 5 levy vote. More specifically, that dudes are going to give up their monster trucks or Dodge Chargers for “BRTs” or Bus Rapid Transit. While others are going to relinquish their Audis, Mercedes and Tesla’s, even as the numbers of these luxury cars are increasing on Columbus freeways and streets.

Ditching your ride for a bicycle and a bus will not apply to everyone, insists COTA spokesperson Jeff Pullin, but they’re hoping many Columbus residents get on board and leave their car in the garage or forgo a car altogether.

“We are not asking everybody to give up their car, but we know there are people out there, especially people who are younger, who are not really wanting to take on that cost of the car. It costs upward to $600 to $700 a month to have a car in some cases,” he said to the *Free Press*.",Columbus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/1g5wkwp/ditch_your_tesla_for_an_accordion_bus_the_future/,10/17/2024 17:37,103,147,ohio

walked a little further down to find the car that got the worst of it and who i assumed caused the crash. this car seemingly spun and hit the nearby scaffolding and took out a few support beams, a tree and a bunch of shit on the sidewalk as you can see in the other photos. i overheard someone who witnessed it directly saying the 2nd car was briefly on fire after crashing too. no idea if the people in the 2nd car were seriously injured or not but i assume it must have been pretty bad since they were wheeling a gurney over to that car and the cops and paramedics looked pretty concerned.

I've been almost hit on my local slow street in the cross walk with right of way multiple times - even having to literally jump to avoid a collision at one point. I see my local slow street completely taken over during rush hour by commuters and generally dominated by cars that bully people off the road. And I've been almost hit several other places in the city - always in the cross walk with the signal.

Now - I imagine this is going to be based on where folks live in the city - so this story won't hold for everyone.

1gmcy0o,Suggestions about apartments between Blue Ash/Mason? Vehicles? ,"Hi friends, I am going to start work in Blue Ash next month. I come from Los Angeles, where I experienced three burglaries (two attempted and one completed), one car smash, and three stolen bicycles. There was that one time when I genuinely felt my life was threatened (the culprit was standing at the end of my bed when I realized it). So I'm looking for a relatively safe apartment to live in, preferably one in a secluded area not too accessible on foot by homeless people. I did some research, and somebody told me Mason is the safest place to live, so I went to [apartment.com](http://apartment.com) to see, but the price was kind of over my budget (under $1100 for studio/1B1B). There are some apartments that look great but are already not available. So, with that said, I was wondering if anyone here has any recommendations or referral reductions for good apartments at/in the middle of Blue Ash and Mason? I could suitably go up a little on my budget, but I'm a recent graduate after all, and would still like to try and save a little money.

 

Also, I want to ask, would you guys recommend driving an EV in Cincinnati? My dad and I were talking about letting me take the family's gasoline car or EV, and I kind of want to drive a Tesla to save money on gas, but I have a little bit of concern about whether I'll need to warm up the car earlier/change to snow tire in the winter or if there will be too few charging stations. (I actually started out searching to see if any of the apartments had parking lots with charging stations, but the fancy apartments that did have them were way toooooo expensive.)

  
Thanks. Any comments and suggestions are welcome! You can also dm me!",cincinnati,https://www.reddit.com/r/cincinnati/comments/1gmcy0o/suggestions_about_apartments_between_blue/,11/8/2024 7:14,0,21,ohio

1gst0xt,Are Sub-400k Single Houses In The Boston Area Worth It?,"I (23M) am currently living in a 300 sqft studio in Cambridge and looking for a bigger house (ideally between 500 and 700 sqft and felt like anything more would result in at least one empty room). I have decided on renting the Allister Deco in Quincy due to the Red Line, affordability (I commute to Cambridge 2-3x a week for networking and I am planning to return once my PhD starts in 2 years), and modern amenities. According to the website, after the $125 per month parking fee, rent will equal $2135, which includes free EV charging (I own a Tesla Model 3 btw).

Even though I make more than 6 figures on my main SW Consulting job and with several sources of income, I make well over 250k annually, and own at least a million in investments, having started investing in 2019, I wanted to save my money to funnel into my tech startup, so I believe 400k for a single house is reasonable, and I will put 100k down. In fact, I even found a 720 sqft house in Quincy that sold for $400,200. I am totally aware that interest rates are somewhere around 7%, so monthly payments are going to range around 2500 a month.  Due to this, I am contemplating between putting 100k and paying outright.

For many of the sub-400k single houses (especially turn key like my family members suggest), I would have to buy in a less affluent area at least 20-30 miles away from Downtown Boston - as the crow flies (mostly in the Plymouth, Bristol, and Worcester counties, and some in Middlesex, Essex, and Norfolk counties), such as:

Haverhill, Methuen, Lawrence, Lowell, Bellingham,  Attleboro, Taunton, Brockton, Bridgewater, Middleborough

Most seem to be in the South Coast (i.e. Fall River, New Bedford, Rehoboth, Acushnet, Fairhaven, Dighton, Wareham) or Worcester, both of which are at least 30-40 mi away from Downtown Boston/Kendall Square as the crow flies, but I would gravitate towards Worcester County because Worcester has WPI and the biotech industry, and I also found a 415k house in Northborough and a 360k house in Milford that I adore.

Upon further research, I found out most of these houses are a 30-50 minute drive to Boston and during rush hour, more like 60-110 minutes for one direction. Even though many are middle class (like Attleboro, Milford, Bellingham, Rehoboth, Bridgewater, etc), some of these towns are working class and up and coming (like Lowell, Taunton, Haverhill, Worcester, Leominster), and some (like Lawrence, Fall River, New Bedford) have issues with crime. Even though I don't have children, the schools tend to be average at best (except for Northborough, where schools are rated A+ or 9/10).

As a techie and immigrant from Vietnam, given some of these towns are more conservative and less diverse than Cambridge (where I currently reside), I am still skeptical of the culture of many of those towns.

However, I would be open to buying a fixer upper in an affluent suburb and then renovating them for another 50-100k (especially if I will earn sweat equity), but they are hard to come by. I did find some specimens in Canton, North Reading, and Sudbury over the past three months.

TL;DR: are those sub-400k single houses worth it if I am planning to commute to Cambridge at least once a week or should I steer clear? Many of the houses are in acceptable, but boring neighbourhoods, but some neighbourhood more deprived neighbourhoods. I really don't value a single house, but my family is pressuring me to buy one.",boston,https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1gst0xt/are_sub400k_single_houses_in_the_boston_area/,11/16/2024 18:03,0,9,massachusetts

1h6y46n,Asked ChatGPT to do a Satirical Roast of Bozeman. The response:,"Ah, Bozeman, Montana—a place so idyllic it’s as if the town planners read Better Homes and Gardens and said, “Let’s build a personality cult around this.” It’s where trust funds meet flannel shirts, and cowboy boots are scuffed just enough to look authentic, but not so much that they threaten resale value at REI.

The Economy:
Bozeman’s real estate market is like a bad Tinder match: overpriced, commitment-phobic, and wildly out of touch with reality. It’s a place where a one-bedroom apartment costs more than a down payment on a ranch in Wyoming. But hey, at least your neighbors are startup founders debating blockchain… while sitting on the deck of their fourth vacation home.

The Culture:
Bozeman prides itself on being the gateway to Yellowstone, but let’s be real—Yellowstone’s the main event, and Bozeman is just the overpriced snack bar you stop at on the way. The “locals” (a term that now includes anyone who moved there within the last 12 months) brag about their outdoor lifestyle, which largely consists of Instagramming from trailheads and talking about fly fishing while their actual rod gathers dust in the garage.

The Weather:
Bozeman weather is a lesson in tough love. You move there for “four seasons,” only to discover that three of them are winter, and the fourth is just mud. But don’t worry—your Patagonia jacket will look great against the gray skies, as long as you don’t mind frostbite.

The Vibe:
The town’s unofficial motto is “Keep Bozeman Weirdly Wealthy.” It’s a place where yoga studios outnumber grocery stores, and the local food co-op has a cheese aisle that could make a Parisian weep. Just don’t ask for Velveeta; they’ll politely suggest you try Billings.

In Conclusion:
Bozeman is like that friend who went on one hike and now insists they’re “connected to nature,” all while driving a Tesla to Whole Foods. It’s beautiful, yes—but with all the artisanal coffee shops and overpriced boutiques, it feels less like Montana and more like a Portland suburb that wandered too far east.",Bozeman,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bozeman/comments/1h6y46n/asked_chatgpt_to_do_a_satirical_roast_of_bozeman/,12/5/2024 2:11,275,60,montana

1h7esna,"Are ""yuppies"" changing Boise?","Posting from a throwaway for privacy.

My husband and I moved here 2 years ago after falling in love with Boise during a random visit when we had car trouble on a road trip 4 years ago. It became our dream to live here and despite being a POC and initially worried about standing out, I’ve found Boise to be incredibly welcoming.

The other day, I was walking on the Greenbelt when a man on a fast e-bike sped past me. I overheard an older gentleman behind me say he’s “tired of all the rich yuppies moving here and clogging up the Greenbelt.” It got me thinking—what does “yuppie” even mean in the context of Boise?

Sure there are a lot of Teslas, Subarus, Rad power kiddie hauler e-bikes, and hip third-wave coffee shops here - Boise definitely has lots of amenities that appeal to hip zoomers and millennials.

But - Boise still feels authentic to me in a way places like Boulder or Austin don’t.  Those things haven’t felt overwhelming here at all. In my experience, a good chunk of people are extremely welcoming here and seem passionate about taking care of all the natural and man-made amenities that make Boise great (greenbelt / protected foothills, Bogus etc.).

1hakpov,OUC Demand Level charges will selectively affect EV owners,"OUC’s upcoming PeakSHIFT pricing model includes added fees for people that exceed certain power draw thresholds. 

Looking at the proposed cutoffs, it will, whether intentionally or unintentionally, almost perfectly target EV owners. As proposed, these are the fees:

- Tier 1: ≥0 and <8 kW → $5.00/month 
- Tier 2: ≥8 and <12 kW → $10.00/month 
- Tier 3: ≥12 kW → $15.00/month 

Note that a Tesla home charger (level 2) by default draws 11.5 kW, which means if your AC kicks in while you’re charging, boom, now you’re paying a $10 penalty compared to non-EV owners. Setting the highest cut-off just barely above the draw of a level 2 charger almost guarantees that every home-charging EV owner will pay the highest fees. 

Unless people stop using their home charger as intended, these fees won’t help the grid in any way. So now it just ends up being a selective penalty for EV owners, with zero benefit for the grid. 

Does anybody here have insight on why such power draw based fees were pushed? It seems much more productive to encourage people to charge outside peak times. *That* would actually benefit the grid, and “shift the peak”. ",orlando,https://i.redd.it/4svtqiqj3w5e1.jpeg,12/9/2024 21:19,60,61,florida

1hcsxpa,I asked ChatGPT to roast Santa Barbara!,"Saw this trend and wanted to join the fun!

Here’s a playful roast of some Santa Barbara neighborhoods:

Montecito

Ah, Montecito, where the air is cleaner, the lawns are greener, and the houses are… all owned by Oprah. It’s so exclusive that even the avocado trees have trust funds. The only “community problem” here is deciding if one’s new Tesla should be matte black or pearl white.

Downtown Santa Barbara

The heart of SB—or, as some locals call it, the land of eternal tourists. Downtown has more wine tasting rooms than parking spots. State Street? A charming mix of overpriced boutiques, panhandling musicians, and street art that’s either stunning or “abstract” (read: someone spilled paint).

The Mesa

Where people live just close enough to the beach to tell you about it, but far enough that the walk will leave them winded. The Mesa has a stunning ocean view for every house that also comes with stunningly poor Wi-Fi service.

Isla Vista

The crown jewel of student chaos. It’s a mix of frat parties, questionable life choices, and the ever-present smell of beer and surf wax. Who needs a library when you’ve got “oceanfront keg stands”? The potholes here have probably seen more action than most of the UCSB dorms.

Goleta

Goleta: the land of Costco runs and ranch-style homes. It’s the part of Santa Barbara that screams, “I like it here, but not $5 million worth.” It’s like the suburb that Santa Barbara keeps trying to ghost, but it just keeps showing up.

Hope Ranch

Fancy, private, and gated. Hope Ranch is where horse trails outnumber sidewalks, and the people who live here are so rich they don’t even bother to brag about it. Even their gardeners probably have guest houses.

Funk Zone

The Funk Zone, where everyone’s a “creative.” This is where hipsters sip $18 craft cocktails while waxing poetic about the “soul” of their screen-printed T-shirt business. If it’s not reclaimed wood or dipped in kombucha, it’s not worth your time.

Summerland

A small town with big vacation energy. Summerland is what happens when you combine Montecito pretentiousness with Goleta’s laid-back vibes. The antique shops are adorable, but who’s really paying $400 for a “vintage” driftwood sculpture?

However, the orders kept on getting worse, and I am planning to stop Doordashing after New Year's Day. Doordash has started to become unsustainable and a time waster, and on a good evening, I'd expect about 90-120 in 3 hours, and on average, I'd earn 60-75 after tips in 3 hours. Even though the order volume stayed stable, Doordash has been giving me orders that have a low pay per mile/time. I also feel like I am the only young professional doing this gig in Boston.

I am not doing Doordash for the money (I mainly do it for the fresh air and I use my Tesla, but try my best to find parking), but due to Doordash becoming unsustainable, I might switch to biking, where I would lose and maintain a healthy weight whilst having some fresh air daily. My cousin (29M) lured me into Doordash, despite the fact I have read a dozen articles in prior years stating that Uber drivers (not UE/DD) are paid below minimum wage after expenses (that was in 2019).

1iazgw1,Non-Tesla Solar Recommendations,"We own a 1200 square foot home in central San Diego with an ADU in the back that’s approximately 500 square feet. SDG&E bill used to be ~$150 to $250 at the very highest (use appliances limitedly in the peak hours; use central heat and air moderately as needed and mostly avoid peak hours). We have one plug-in hybrid vehicle that only charges overnight (typically 10 PM to 6 AM). Our past four bills were $162, $237, with $471 last bill, and most recently $615. Our routine and power usage has not changed much and can only imagine it’s only going to get worse with SDG&E.

I’ve been researching solar and would like to invest in panels and a battery with a solid company. I recently got seven quotes from EnergySage and out of all seven quotes the only company to not include Tesla products in the quote was Sunergy. It seems like most companies go with Tesla products, and we are simply not on board with giving money to any company that associates with that brand in any capacity. Thoughts on Sunergy or any other companies who do not use Tesla products?

However, I’ve always felt a little insecure about living in Naperville from a financial standpoint. At times it feels like I’m “punching above my weight” if that makes sense. I make a pretty good salary at my job ($150k) and my wife currently is a stay at home. Most of my earnings go towards the mortgage, utilities, groceries, student loans, etc. Nothing crazy. But we rarely have anything left over to splurge with. 

Meanwhile, if you take a trip down route 59 you’ll notice every other person driving a Tesla or expensive car (even high schoolers). Our neighbors are constantly traveling and going on lavish trips. Even going downtown will make you feel broke. There isn’t a day the lululemon store isn’t packed.

Does anyone else ever feel like maybe they dont “belong” in Naperville from an economic standpoint?

We’re definitely not struggling. I’ve never missed a mortgage payment and always have food on the table.

I have no idea how the land deals Tesla made with Nambe and Santa Ana were structured, but I’d love to see both of them find an excuse to cancel those leases and kick Tesla out of our state. It's never to early to get on the Everybody Hates Elon bandwagon.

Tesla’s financials from last year are horrible. Their January sales have fallen off of a cliff in Europe and Asia with multiple countries reporting 40-60% year over year decreases, and at least part of that has to be attributed to Elon's recent far-right behavior. Meanwhile, their cars have largely been surpassed in features and quality by offerings from the other major manufacturers. If Tesla becomes the car of the far-right do you think enough of Elon's fans will buy them for it to remain a viable company?

Roughly half of Elon Musk's net worth is derived from Tesla. It's also the part of his empire that is the most vulnerable to actions by normal people.

And all of that happened without any intervention from the Cybertruck’s suite of active safety systems.

The driver wrote on twitter that his cybertruck was in full self-driving system mode but that it failed to recognize the lane setup.

“It failed to merge out of a lane that was ending (there was no one on my left) and made no attempt to slow down or turn until it had already hit the curb,”

Please don’t draw swastikas on other people’s cars. Please also don’t write “Sig Heil” on other people’s cars.

Covering cars in Nazi symbolism is in fact not an anti-nazi thing to do.

Also, just in general, please stop touching other people’s things? I bought my Model 3 because I wanted to buy an electric car that was fun to drive and the Model 3 was the only car in my price range. I imagine this person would not rather me have bought a sporty car that burns gas instead? People who buy electric cars are overwhelmingly liberal.

1j47b7x,Lunatic drivers,"Here is an example of the lunacy of driving in Colorado Springs. I'm driving northbound from Fontanero onto Templeton Gap Road, minding my own business, not doing anything weird. Guy in SUV comes up behind me and blasts around in the no passing zone, throwing up dust and gravel, trying to cut me off as he gets back into the lane. Fine, he's an idiot or on drugs or late for a dentist appointment, I get it. Chalk it up to routine idiocy.

But then he proceeds to drive up the rest of the way to Fillmore obeying the speed limit, slowing down when another car might be wanting to make a turn, going slowly past Mann Middle School, signaling when turning onto Fillmore. So what is going on? Why is he suddenly Mr Good Driving Habits? Maybe he felt guilty about trying to kill me and decided to back off? Maybe he didn't like the color of my car? Maybe he's on the phone now and doing the ""on the phone at 10 MPH under the speed limit"" thing?

**The Price of Power**

He slashes jobs with ruthless hand,  
Veterans left to roam the land.  
The aid once sent to those in need,  
Now lost to wealth and power’s greed.

The hungry cry, their voices fade,  
As USAID is torn, unmade.  
A leader walks, his child in tow,  
A shield against a hidden foe.

When power plays in broad daylight.

Many Tesla drivers aren’t wealthy; they own entry-level models (3 and Y) and bought their vehicles long before Elon Musk’s recent actions stirred controversy.  The last thing they need right now is to deal with property damage or injury caused by misdirected public anger.

If you’re reading this, it’s unlikely you’re directly impacted by the Tesla CEO’s role in the federal government. Some of you might be, but I’d wager most are not. For those who aren’t but are simply frustrated by Elon Musk’s influence, please do not turn to violence or vandalism—it only strengthens the opposition and harms innocent Americans.

Violence has no place here.

Sincerely,A Fellow Angeleno

God, it infuriates me because I’ve almost gotten hit (going into the parking lot) but drivers going through the stop sign when they shouldn’t and I always use my turn signal to let people know I’m turning.

Then today I was at the stop sign waiting for oncoming traffic to finish because, as usual, about 1/2 were turning and 1/2 were going straight and unless I know for sure, I won’t go through the stop sign cause I don’t need to get into an accident. While I’m waiting, a stupid Tesla driver (which made me more mad) was obnoxiously honking at me because I wasn’t going. My wife and I pointed to the sign and this stupid lady just wouldn’t stop honking. I physically cannot comprehend why people can’t read signs in parking lots, genuinely am I missing something?

1jcxw81,Should Nevada Audit Tesla’s Gigafactory?,"Back in 2014, Nevada gave Tesla over $1.25 billion in tax breaks to build the Gigafactory outside Reno. The deal was supposed to bring thousands of high-paying jobs and boost the local economy. Now that it’s been nearly a decade, I think it’s fair to ask: Did Nevada actually get what it was promised?

A few things stand out:

Where did all that tax money go? Nevada gave Tesla one of the largest corporate tax breaks in state history. We should know if it actually benefited the state or just padded Tesla’s profits.

What about the jobs? Tesla promised stable, high-paying jobs for Nevadans, but there have been reports of temp contracts, layoffs, and lower-than-expected wages.

Worker safety issues. Multiple reports have come out about injuries and poor working conditions at the Gigafactory, with some incidents allegedly going unreported.

Housing prices skyrocketed. Since Tesla moved in, housing in the Reno-Sparks area has become significantly more expensive. Meanwhile, Tesla is still paying little to no state taxes.

I think it’s reasonable for Nevada to conduct an independent audit of Tesla’s tax incentives, job impact, and worker conditions. If they held up their end of the deal, great. But if they didn’t, we should know about it.

What do you think? Did Tesla end up being a good deal for Nevada, or did we give away too much for too little in return?

Musk sure preaches a lot about transparency, accountability and efficiency, I think it’s only fair he gets back what he gives then- and we should be auditing his Tesla Gigafactory since after all- WE taxpayers gave him over a billion dollars for it.

EDIT: After looking into it more, it turns out Nevada has conducted audits of Tesla, but they have been limited in scope. They check if Tesla meets job and investment commitments, but they don’t track where Tesla’s tax breaks actually go or fully investigate worker safety issues.

Here’s what we now know:

- Nevada has given Tesla over $1.25 billion in tax breaks—but we still don’t have full transparency on how that money was used.

-Audits have confirmed Tesla met hiring and investment targets, but they don’t tell us if the tax breaks actually benefited Nevadans or just boosted Tesla’s profits.

-OSHA has found serious worker safety violations at the Gigafactory, but Tesla has been accused of underreporting injuries, and state inspections have been limited.

-Even Storey County officials (where the Gigafactory is located) are now pushing for stricter oversight, saying Tesla’s deal strained local infrastructure and public safety services.",Reno,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reno/comments/1jcxw81/should_nevada_audit_teslas_gigafactory/,3/16/2025 22:43,459,264,nevada
1jcytqb,"Please, do not endanger my life because of the car I drive. I despise what Tesla has become. If anyone knows a Toyota Dealership who has an honest salesman - I will trade in my Model S for a 2024 Prius. I’m not kidding.","This is the 3rd incident this week and they’re ramping up. I had to call the cops on a dually truck who ran me off the side of the highway, I had an instance where an SUV didn’t let me safely merge this morning while being flicked off, another car just ignored my turn signal, sped up and pushed into my lane, people have aggressively passing normal for Columbus however, this has been like bumper to bumper close. I’m tired boss.

I don’t mind the constant birds. Fuck Tesla. We are traveling at 70+ MPH - please, do not toy with someone’s life. It’s become such a liability for me to even drive because it’s anxiety inducing. I still have a car payment on this thing. I have tried to sell this stupid vehicle, no one’s actually interested because I’ve been spammed by people trying to waste my time for being a Tesla car owner. (Yes, this a real thing that is happening) I think the reason my car in particular garnishes more attention is possibly my license plate? I think it’s an excellent opportunity for marketing if a local dealership wants to help me out.

I am a Creative Consultant and want nothing to do with this brand. What dealership has a used 2024 Prius in Black who can help me? It looks bitchin’, it serves my eco-friendly goals and it would be embarrassing for Tesla. I build pitch decks for a living. Cash + trade or 1:1 - whatever deal I can find. I think there’s a serious opportunity to cause some upset. And start a powder-keg for losing one of the most recognizable names - to a Prius. Hell yes. 


EDIT: Wow! This blew up! Y’all are so nice here too! So, based on feedback - may have to be very selective with what dealership I go for. CV offered a decent amount. I still think this post has demonstrably proven, this could be a sick marketing stunt, if we find a dealer. Especially with my plate. I don’t want to spoil what it is.

A restaurant on West Blvd. was held up twice in a week, the first time they managed to trap one of the robbers inside but it took two hours for the police to arrive to arrest him. (He was apparently trying to steal cleaning supplies.) They were then robbed by someone else the next day.  

La escasez de oficiales de policía y el alto volumen de llamadas de emergencia están afectando gravemente a los negocios locales, como El Sazón Latino Restaurant en West Boulevard, que ha sido víctima de dos asaltos en solo una semana.  
El primer incidente ocurrió el martes cuando dos sujetos intentaron robar productos de limpieza. Aunque uno escapó, el otro quedó atrapado dentro de la tienda. La policía tardó dos horas en llegar debido a la falta de recursos, lo que generó aún más preocupación.  
Al día siguiente, un segundo robo ocurrió, esta vez por un hombre hispano. Los empleados de la tienda temen por la seguridad de la zona, ya que los delincuentes saben que la policía no llegará a tiempo y no serán arrestados.

1jdzjaa,Private Security Vehicles and Sirens,"I was on the ~6500 block of N. Whipple the other day and a Tesla Cybertruck flew down the street, it had to be going at least 40 MPH if not faster. It had the decals of a private security company on it, I couldn’t make out which one. Let’s just say Halo Security for purposes of this discussion. I know that some neighborhoods have hired these security companies at times to patrol their neighborhood streets (I’ve been harassed a time or two by them, not here, but up on 7700 block of Paulina). 

It also had red sirens flashing and audio sirens as well. There may have been white, I don’t trust my own memory totally tho. Here’s my question: 

Is that allowed? I mean, for all intents and purposes, it is still a private, civilian vehicle. Doesn’t it have to 1) obey the speed limit and 2) not pretend to be a law enforcement vehicle? 

Unless CPD has Cybertrucks now, but I sort of doubt that. ",chicago,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/comments/1jdzjaa/private_security_vehicles_and_sirens/,3/18/2025 7:31,7,6,illinois

From the US National Weather Service Norman Oklahoma

We're looking at a potentially very unusual overnight wildfire environment. We've received a lot of questions about the best ways to receive alerts for nearby fires.

Here are some available options:

-NOAA Weather Radio: Fire warnings issued by our office will be broadcasted immediately on your NWR. This is a great option if you're sleeping and want to have alerts available. Evacuation orders will also reach NWRs.

-Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) on your phone: These are a great option for receiving Evacuation Immediate orders when you're asleep. They will trigger automatically on your phone if you're in the area. Our fire warnings will NOT trigger WEAS.

-Social media/local broadcast media: These are great

ways to stay up-to-date on weather/fire hazards as they occur tonight *as long as you're already wake. The key thing here will be having some way to wake up if needed.

We're putting all of this out here not so that people panic, but so that they're able to prepare. Much like with our severe/tornado outbreaks, most people will NOT be impacted by a wildfire tonight. Remain prepared and aware!

I also included a picture of an app that I found that shows the fires around us!",okc,https://i.redd.it/fy0l1g0jxjpe1.png,3/19/2025 1:46,146,32,oklahoma

1jfufjq,Global Tesla Protest Saturday 3/29 #TeslaTakedown,"Hello,

There will be protests happening on Saturday 3/29 and the goal is to have protestors present outside of every showroom in the world. Please join 😁.

https://actionnetwork.org/event_campaigns/teslatakedown

1jg0qza,Next DOGE/Musk Protest at Santa Rosa Tesla Service Center March 22nd #TeslaTakedown,"Since there is a lot of interest on this sub about the [\#TeslaTakedown](https://www.teslatakedown.com/) protests--my last post got over 2k+ upvotes, 95% positive (i.e., you aren't alone!), I am letting everyone know there is another DOGE and Musk protest at the Santa Rosa Tesla showroom/service center on **Saturday, March 22nd, from 11:00 to 1:00**. The protests keep growing each week. There will be an even more significant global event on March 29th.   
  
When I've posted about this in the past, some commenters have asked the purpose of these protests. That is a legitimate question. The #TeslaTakedown movement aims to generate awareness about Trump's Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE), headed by Elon Musk, illegal actions against our democracy. Hurting Tesla's stock price, a large portion of Musk's fortune, is one of the most direct ways to have our voices heard.   
  
And it is working. This is evident in the increasingly desperate nature Musk is taking to try and keep his stock prices up--having Trump shill for him on the White House lawn and having the Sec. of Commerce, Lutnick, go on Fox and ask people to buy Tesla stock. And the stock is down from $400/share to (checks website) $236/share. [Each  $2.43 dip costs Musk $1b.](https://sherwood.news/markets/every-time-tesla-shares-decline-usd2-43-elon-musk-loses-another-billion/) Ouch.

This is a non-violent protest. We don't block traffic. We yell and wave signs. We don't shame Tesla drivers. There was a point about 2 years ago when I was ready to buy a Tesla, but I got a better deal on another EV. Tesla owners were doing something they thought was good. Unfortunately, that has changed. 

  
[Indivisible Sonoma County](https://indivisiblesoco.org/) is helping organize these protests as well.

Hope to see you there!

My Grandpa started it, passed down to my Dad in 1988. Our family has been in this valley for a loooong time. Unfortunately the opportunity to buy the building had never arose, been renting it this whole time, so I’m sure my Dad has paid for it and some. There’s never been an offer ether. He currently pays $3500 a month, and they demanded he signs a new lease this coming Monday, with an automatic $25% increase. To top it off starting this November owner will make it another 25% increase yearly once November roles around. Basically they’re trying to push us out for good.

This timing comes less than 2 weeks after a new heater had to be installed, and my Dad legit said I bet the rent gets raised or they’ll try to pull some shit. The heater was unsafe, a literal kill hazard, there was carbon monoxide exposure in the building.

My family has busted their asses off keeping this place running and it kills me to see it go down like this. The actual owner of the building resides in California. The property company hated breaking the news to us, but  that’s just on the owners request. Not sure what to do, sick to my stomach and lost for words by the amount of greed. We never ask for repairs, never bug them, but we know we’re just a small fish in a big pond when it comes to the kind of money they have.

I’ve been protesting the tesla dealership this week. On Fridays and Saturdays there are large planned protests but I’ve been showing up by  the other days as well. My sign says “you know a nazi when you see one” with a sketch of musk’s salute

Thursday (3/21)when I was there someone in a red car driving by gave a nazi salute. I stayed an hour or 90 minutes longer. Then immediately after I left, as I was driving home, there was a honk and the same person(white male, 20s, shoulder length light brown or blonde hair) was driving in the lane next to me grinning throwing the salute again, I then realized there was another car , with the driver(white male 20a, short black hair ) also throwing the salute.  
So this person waited an hour + and called a buddy to follow and intimidate me.

Thought it would be at least worth filing a report, but the Washtenaw sheriff deputy I spoke to seemed confused as to why I was calling.

1jhlvoy,What Are Some Cash Only Establishments In And Around Boston?,"Between 2023 and 2024, 99% of purchases I made in the Greater Boston area are using credit or debit card, and the only time I was forced to use cash (besides laundry) was during the MIT Swapfest and during Tet 2024 at the Seaport to buy food. Whenever I receive cash (which seldom happens), I usually deposit it in the ATM. My apartment uses a coin slot laundry.

At some petrol stations, you would save 10 cents per gallon, but all the petrol stations I visited accepts credit card. Tesla Superchargers and Chargepoint Level 2 chargers only accept credit card, and I have been an avid credit card user, with me preferring credit card even when I travel to Europe/Asia because I incur no transaction fees due to having a travel credit card. The only countries I have visited in the past 5 years which is cash reliant (where I need some cash to survive) are Montenegro, Bosnia, Albania, Thailand, and Vietnam. I visited 27 European countries (combination of EU and non-EU) and I only had to use cash for laundry and luggage storage services (mostly). 

I am currently in Albania and even though many places start to accept credit cards, cash is still necessary for some restaurants, to use public transportation, to pay for intercity bus tickets (as bus companies like Flixbus are seldom and instead, there are companies like Butrini tours), to pay for some hotel accommodations, and to pay for the House of Leaves Museum.

I have encountered only three cash only establishments so far in the Greater Boston area, and they include the Saigon Corner Cantonese Restaurant in Quincy, the New Windsor Dim Sum Restaurant in Quincy, and the Copeland Pizza in Quincy.",boston,https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1jhlvoy/what_are_some_cash_only_establishments_in_and/,3/22/2025 23:36,0,23,massachusetts

Legitimate question - I see a lot of outrage on this subreddit about the T_ump administration, constitution crisis, etc etc. but the protests are all targeted at the individual dems who are the minority party. I keep hearing do something, but like, what? Why aren’t people protesting republican things since they actually do have some power. Dems can’t even get a bill to the senate or house floor to be voted on without the tops Reps putting it there. 

In the meantime, all these protests are feeding into the republican narrative of the Dem party as being fractured and disorganized. There was a post office protest today downtown that some Palestine solidarity group hopped onto and started yelling at the Dem Representative who was there supporting the postal workers. Like how is that supposed to help the cause in the long run? It sure as shit doesn’t help postal workers at their own gd protest.

1jibe2i,Tesla Protest News Coverage,"As someone who was in attendance at the recent protest, and someone who values truth and context, I want to provide a more accurate and comprehensive account of the events, especially in light of the coverage on Fox News, which I found to be highly lacking in context and clarity. Channel 8's coverage was somewhat better, and I am unable to access the Tulsa World’s coverage due to their paywall.

Firstly, it’s important to clarify that there was no vandalism on either side of the protest. This was a peaceful demonstration where we exercised our protected (for now) First Amendment rights.

Participants chanted, waved at passing cars, and received overwhelming support from the majority of drivers. I would estimate that for every three cars offering gestures of solidarity, one would respond with a middle finger, obscenities, or attempts at intimidation. Some individuals even drove around multiple times, yelling at us or making hostile gestures. While this behavior was unpleasant, it was expected, especially given the location of the protest in BA. 

As protestors, we consistently reminded everyone that we are advocating for the rights of all individuals, not just a select few. Regardless of where people stand on the issues, we are ultimately fighting for the rights and dignity of every person. Additionally, while some of us did engage in civil discourse with counter-protestors, none of these interactions escalated in a way that would be deemed threatening or problematic.

However, there are several important details about the counter-protestors that have not been reported by any major news outlets:

Weapon Display: One counter-protester made a deliberate effort to display his holstered weapon as he mingled among us. This act appeared intended to provoke and intimidate. We are an open carry state, and he was within his rights, but given the tension and aggression coming from counter protestors and the amount of mass shootings in this country, it seemed highly unnecessary and inappropriate. 

Inappropriate Behavior: A counter-protester, affiliated with the Westboro Baptist Church, was present solely to divide and antagonize. His comments, which included offensive and irrelevant remarks about genitals and sex, were not only inappropriate but disturbing, especially given the presence of children.

Attempted Assault: A counter-protester, from his truck, threw a large cup filled with wet food at us. Fortunately, no one was hit, but this act is clearly an attempt at assault.

Reckless Endangerment: Another counter-protester, from the safety of his vehicle, drove dangerously close to the protestors, revving his engine and spewing thick black smoke from his exhaust. While we were able to endure the discomfort, this was an obvious attempt to intimidate and harass, and seemed especially vile given that children were present in the crowd.

While none of these actions were surprising, they are significant and should be reported alongside the biased and selectively edited coverage that attempts to portray the counter-protestors as victims simply advocating for peace and freedom.

If that were truly the case, one has to question why such aggressive, thoughtless,  harassing, and even dangerous behavior was directed toward peaceful protestors.


EDIT:
Wow so it was even worse than I personally witnessed. Someone WAS in fact hit with the shit that person threw out the window. AND someone was followed and stalked by a counter protestor.

I guess I’ll never complain about a smashed window in the city ever again which is a minor nuisance compared to having your car torched for no apparent reason.

1jjrq1i,Gothamist: NYC pensions have more than $1B in Elon Musk’s Tesla,"""As Elon Musk slashes spending and targets federal agencies, his once popular electric carmaker Tesla is taking a beating. Protests have erupted at dealerships across the country, including in New York City; Tesla owners are selling off their cars and the stock price is plummeting.

Justin Brannan, a Democratic City Council member who’s running for city comptroller, is vowing to aim another dagger at the company if elected — by leading an effort to have the city pensions divest completely from Tesla holdings worth an estimated $1.2 billion.

“Elon Musk is coming for us,” Brannan told Gothamist in an interview. “Why should we be investing retirees’ hard-earned pension funds in a guy who’s already shown that he’s got New York City in the crosshairs?” ""

Elon Musk is destroying our democracy, and he's using the fortune he built at Tesla to do it. We are taking action at Tesla to stop Musk's illegal coup.

This Saturday, 3/29, is our GLOBAL Tesla Takedown Day of Action. We are aiming for 500+ protests (across the 277 North American showrooms + superchargers and other locations)!

Our PEACEFUL protests are absolutely essential in undermining Musk’s bottom line and helping curtail the damage done by DOGE. [Please join us by attending or HOSTING an event at teslatakedown.com](https://www.teslatakedown.com)! We still have many unclaimed showrooms - if you’re nervous about organizing your first event, please don’t hesitate to reach out! I’m happy to offer support and can also connect you with upcoming official Tesla Takedown office hours.

Please see our incredible call to action (I was joined by John Cusack, Rep.

The one thing we don't do is shame Tesla drivers, they did a good thing at one point and most likely agree with the cause. 

Details:
Saturday, March 29th
11:00 to 1:00 p.m.
Tesla Service Center and Showroom
3286 Airway Dr, Santa Rosa, CA 95403

Everyone was so normal that I can hope it may have done something to dispel some of the propaganda Trump and Musk are putting out there about the protests. Well done everyone! Keep it up!

1jn2n6q,"Tesla owners of Dayton, how are y’all doin’?","I own a Tesla Model S. I was obsessed with Tesla since 2013 when I was a poor college student. I was excited about Tesla seeming like it was sticking it to Big Auto dealerships, the underdog was succeeding, I absolutely loved the Tesla “Cult” like family. And living in California at the time they were everywhere. I remember my wife and I sitting in our car watching Teslas come and go from a local supercharger… multiple times. For our one year wedding anniversary we road tripped and camped up the California coast and visited the Tesla Factory. When I say obsessed I mean obsessed. 

I had the plan of my next car I purchased for myself would be a Tesla Model S. I was going to drive my current car as long as I could until it died and see where I was at financially. So in 2022 when my 2007 Mazda 3 starting having heater and AC problems (AC had a leak and it would cost more than the car was worth to repair) and I was not financially ready yet I stuck it out through another Ohio winter and summer. Then in 2023 when my transmission started failing, I started looking. I knew I couldn’t afford a Tesla Model S, so I didn’t even get my hopes up. I first looked at used Bolts, then used ID.4s. I was about to pull the trigger on a used ID.4 I found but my wife said “at that price point, let’s see if there are any Model S’s for sale.” So she looked and lo and behold, there was a Model S 100D for sale at a VW dealer North West of Cincinnati for less than my Wife’s Atlas. We swung by carmax that had the ID.4 I was looking at, took it for a 24 hour test drive and drove it down to look at this Tesla to compare.

You see I had struggled with undiagnosed severe depression for the last 10 years and in 2022 I finally found answers. After getting treatment for depression my life and my outlook on life had completely changed. So when this opportunity to purchase “my car”, the car that I would obsessively build on line every day for years, my color, my interior, my 100D, you could see where I am getting at. It seemed like it was one chapter of my life closing and another one opening. A new beginning.

I did it. The car was clean. And I’ve lived it. I know it’s not perfect, but for me I was living my dream. And then Elon had to go and mess it all up. I love my car but I don’t love the hand gestures I have been receiving just driving to work. I don’t love that someone drove reckless to make them selves visible to give my wife finger on her way to deliver a meal to a friend who needed it. I do not agree with this administration’s politics, or how DOGE is doing things, in fact I have actually shed tears with coworkers over these things. I was going to try and stick it out but now I don’t know what to do. If I sell it I feel like Elon wins and don’t mention the taking resell value due to others offload them. If I keep it, I give off the impression that I support things I fundamentally do not believe in and risk vandalism, reckless drivers, and road rage.

So Tesla owners of Dayton, how are y’all doin?

I’m grateful if folks are visiting from out of town, or if these are students are attending local universities. The last time I remember seeing an increase in out of state car plates was around the 2024 election. Rental cars might be a good explanation, but if these are rentals, is there a reason why?

1jnjs2w,"A SIGNATURE EVENT: The DC Protest, April 5th","April 5 will be a big day for the national Save Our Democracy Movement.  On that day, Indivisible, 50501, Move On and other political action organizations will be sponsoring hundreds of demonstrations that will span the country from east to west, out to Hawaii and up to Alaska.

Obviously, the purpose of demonstrations is to be seen and get noticed so a message can be seen by as many people as possible.  People can see the demonstrations in-person or find out about them in the broadcast, online and print media.  Clarity of message and visibility are the keys to successful protests.

The latest number I can find is that Indivisible has 288 recognized groups scattered around the country.  I can’t find out how many 50501 groups there are, but let’s assume 400.  In total, perhaps there will be 700 demonstrations nationwide.  A crowd of 40,000 in Sacramento or 40 in Port Townsend, WA, are important and critical.  They might garner some coverage in the local/regional media.  But they won’t make national headlines.  And I believe it’s too much to assume the average American’s attention would be grabbed by national news coverage that showed a couple of pictures of local demonstrations and stated that there were X hundreds of demonstrations nationwide with a total number of X protestors on April 5.
  
But a picture of 1 million+ demonstrators under the Washington Monument in the nations’ seat of government, spilling down to both ends of the National Mall, now that’s VISIBILITY—a picture is worth a thousand words.  It would garner front-page coverage across America and around the world and would generate a great deal of attention.  

Although there were 400 demonstrations around China in the spring of 1989, it’s the protest on Tiananmen Square by a million protestors that gave voice to what has been called the country’s Democracy Movement.  And even though Arab Spring protests were nationwide in Egypt in January/February of 2011, it was the 2 million people in Tahrir Square in Cairo, Egypt, that came to represent that movement in the country.  Few Americans seem to realize just how threatened our democracy is this spring of 2025.  It’s a crisis, it’s deadly serious and it demands immediate attention.  We now need our own SIGNATURE EVENT to grab attention in this time of grave danger.   Dancing to music in front of Tesla dealerships is fun, but it isn’t going to get it done!   

A massive protest of 1+ million peaceful demonstrators on the National Mall would be that kind of signature event.  That would be a spectacle and an historic event, a gargantuan and complimentary exclamation point in a national day of protest.  It would be a moment gained and emblematic of a growing national movement.  Potentially, such a mass protest would kick the Save Our Democracy Movement into high gear. That’s essential because time is running out in a struggle to save American democracy.

Please proudly participate in your local April 5 protest.  If you’re able, please join other protestors under the Washington Monument on the National Mall at noon on April 5.  You will be part of and a voice in American history and participate in an experience you’ll never forget.

1. Seeing Like a Dissident

I was wrong about one big thing in 2024: I did not realize that most American institutions—the media, the legal world, big business, universities, the tech sector—would immediately capitulate to Trump.

In 2016 I believed the Republican party’s submission was the result of the GOP’s particular failings. That was incorrect. The Republican party was merely the first institution to accept authoritarianism because it was the first institution Trump targeted.

We now see that most institutions are weak in the face of authoritarianism.

JVL’s Law is: Any institution not explicitly anti-Trump will eventually become useful to Trump. I originally thought this would apply only to media orgs. Turns out that it applies to everyone and everything. From Ross Douthat to John Fetterman, from Paul Weiss to Facebook. All of our institutions are the Republican party now.

This is an extraordinary moment and it requires extraordinary vision and actions. We must stop viewing political life through the lens of American politics as we have known it, and adopt the viewpoint of dissident movements in autocratic states.

The Democratic party has more to learn from Alexei Navalny or the protesters in Serbia than it does from Chuck Schumer or strategists obsessing over message-testing crosstabs. This battle is half mass mobilization and half asymmetric warfare. Over the next year those tactics will matter more than traditional political messaging as it has been practiced here in living memory.

Once you accept that reality, our next steps become clear.

The rough roadmap for how to proceed goes like this:

1. Demonstrate popular power in the provinces through large-scale rallies.

2. Use these events to organize the resistance into a mass movement that can be called into action.

3. Direct the mass movement into targeted political strikes: Getting blowout wins in special elections; boycotts of Tesla; etc.

4. Politicize everything: Attack the authoritarians for every bad thing that happens, anywhere in the world. Flood the zone.

5. Elevate the corruption/graft in a way that pits the billionaire insiders against the “forgotten man.”

6. When the moment is right, bring this movement to the Capital for a show of strength.

7. Use this demonstration as a slingshot to take back legislative power in the 2026 elections.

8. More importantly, use it to send a message to the institutional actors that people will have their back if they show courage.

2. The Near Term

Winning in 2026 will not be sufficient to stop the authoritarian push; but it is necessary.

And the only way to win is people power. That’s it. No institutions are going to save us. The courts won’t stop the authoritarians. Corporate interests won’t stop them. The Democratic party won’t stop them, either. If the authoritarians can be stopped then the Democratic party will be the vehicle through which people wield power. But the Democratic party, as an institution, is too weak and desiccated to stage a real fight against Trumpism. It will have to be pushed into fighting by a mass popular movement.

AOC’s public events over the last week have been exactly what the opposition needs.

She is making herself a rally point and telling everyone who wants to resist that they have a place to go. She should do these rallies, over and over, across the country. But not in Washington or New York. Not yet.

When you look at the history of dissident movements, they almost always begin in the outer provinces.

The autocrats’ power is greatest near the literal center of the government they control. The further you get from their power center, the weaker their hold and the more risks they have to take if they want to put down demonstrations.

AOC went to Denver and Phoenix last week. She needs to go to Nashua and Nashville. Houston and Chicago. Oakland and Oklahoma City.

The bigger these rallies get, the better. Make them ongoing events.
She will need an infrastructure. It’s not enough to get 30,000 people in the streets. You need to get them organized. People in the pro-democracy space will need to help figure out how to do that—how to turn live attendance into lists that can be activated.
And when I say “activated” I do NOT mean for fundraising. Keep Act Blue away from this project: These lists should never be used for ginning up donations. They should be used to direct people into actions. Getting them registered to vote. Getting them to turn out for elections. Getting them to show up at the next rally; to organize their friends.

This will require a sophisticated data operation. AOC will need help. It would be great if Mark Cuban or Scott Galloway could step in here. The dissident movement will need its own platform.

It will also need its own media. Because believe me, the New York Times is never going to be explicitly anti-authoritarian.

This movement should have millions of highly activated people attached to it by the end of 2025, building to a show of strength in the summer of 2026. The goal should be a day when 2 million people show up in either New York or Washington and demonstrate that there is an unprecedented mass movement opposing the authoritarians running the federal government.

That’s the moment you force the rest of America to take a side. And the moment you dare Trump to do what he’s always wanted: To take the mask all the way off and use force against American citizens.

The more people you bring out, the greater the provocation and also, the safer the opposition will be. If you put 2 million people in the streets Trump will look weak if he doesn’t respond, but will look like a tyrant if he does.

And everything is about making him unpopular and weak in the final stretch before November 2026.

What will this movement actually look like? I don’t know. These things are unpredictable. But I have a high degree of certainty about one thing: The movement must be, at some level, oppositional to the status quo. It cannot only be a defense of democracy and our institutions, it must be a challenge to them.

One thing I found interesting over the last week is the way that two potential leaders of this movement from opposite ends of the ideological spectrum were both aligned in this framework.

On Tim’s podcast Maryland Governor Wes Moore put it like this:
[Many Americans] don’t see how this system works for them. And the truth is, it hasn’t. And that’s why I think we have to be real, real careful about somehow spending our time defending a status quo, when for real, for many people, the status quo never worked for them. So how are you defending something that’s indefensible?

For AOC this outsider messaging is right there in the branding of their “Fight Oligarchy” barnstorming. She’s anti-establishment enough to talk about needing a Democratic party that fights harder.

AOC: One thing I love about Arizonans is that you all have shown that if a US Senator isn’t fighting hard enough for you, you’re not afraid to replace her with one who will.

The reality is that a mass movement is not going to arise around protecting institutions. The way for us to actually protect our institutions is to rally together behind leaders who commit to reforming them.

3. Solidarity

The last piece of the puzzle is leadership and solidarity. The dissident movement needs a leader. AOC has been the primary person to step up, though Chris Murphy and a few others have been banging the drum. Maybe in time someone else will emerge as a more potent leader for the movement they are incubating. But either way: Without a leader, this movement will not materialize. People need a rally point. History makes that clear.

Whoever this leader is, she will be imperfect. In addition to being imperfect, she will not be everyone’s first choice. If you are a Paul Ryan-style conservative, you will have many disagreements with, say, AOC. If you are a progressive and Mark Cuban becomes the leader of the opposition, you will have many disagreements with him.

Hear me when I say this: There can be no purity tests in the pro-democracy opposition.

You are either against Trump, or not. If you are against Trump then the anti-Trump movement must operate in solidarity. We do not have the luxury of saying, “Well yes, I dislike Trump. But Leader X wants higher marginal tax rates, so I can’t sign on with that.”

This doesn’t mean you have to agree with everyone in the opposition. Just for the sake of argument, let’s pretend it’s October 2026 and AOC is the face of the opposition.

You don’t have to suddenly love the Green New Deal and single-payer healthcare. You can disagree with those policies. But you cannot use those disagreements as pretext to distance yourself from the opposition movement.

Remember: Any person or institution not explicitly anti-Trump becomes useful to him. You are either on the bus or you are off.
And the point of solidarity is that everyone in the anti-Trump opposition needs to support one another. Again: History is clear on this.

So that’s the plan.

Find a leader. Bring people together in person, far away from the capital’s control. Build momentum. Organize your supporters. Harness the power of their mass. Build toward an explicit show of strength. Take back control of Congress.

And then, if we’re lucky, we can start thinking about an endgame.
In the meantime, fight the authoritarians on everything. If the stock market drops, scream about it. Because it’s their fault. When a kid dies of measles—their fault. Attack them every day, on whatever the latest thing is. Turn “flood the zone” against them by not needing to cling to any one outrage for weeks. Embrace the idea of snapping up new outrages every day.

Get hot about them. Be passionate about them. And for the love of all that’s holy, talk like a normal human being, not a canned politician going through the motions.

They decided that the signs saying ""NO LANE CHANGES"" didn't apply to them. The footage will show the car merging infront of the Tesla and brake lights.

Had this vehicle not cutoff the Tesla (urk) that was in front of me, then jammed on the brakes that all of you that ended up in the collisions would have not had to deal with what you did. 

I don't forsee this video evidence holding any weight in a claim having come from an uninvolved party, I dont know the rules, but know that the main person at fault is not one of you. 

I hope that you all are OK and that no one is injured. If you know anyone who was or were involved in the pile up, feel free to DM me if the footage might help.

My biggest interest is in regen.  Driving up 5-6000 feet in elevation then parking in the cold for 6 hours means you leave the resort with a cold battery unable to do any regen right when you need it most.  It must be a big hit on overall range beyond the normal cold-weather loss, given the large elevation changes.

I've seen reports about regen loss on I-70 in Colorado in this thread:

lry9v2,Is it just me or does it feel like drivers are far more aggressive these days?,"I'll be honest, I rarely get out of the inner-most area of Portland. My life, my career, my family, my friends, my gf, pretty much my entire world exists between NW 23rd and SE Caesar Chavez. I've lived here for 20+ years but have been out to Clackamas, Gresham, Beaverton and Hillsboro probably no more than 6-7 times total, combined. Not sure why, I just never venture out beyond where my places and peeps are. I've been to the coast probably 20-30 times more than I have any of the above mentioned areas. 

Anyway..

Lately I've had to make routine trips to areas in Tanasbourne/Hillsboro and I must say the amount of aggression and rage from drivers out there is fucking unreal. I swear, it seems at almost every red light or every turn there is someone cutting me off or tailgating me despite going the speed limit. Weird things where someone will race up on my side, get in front of me then slow down, not a brake check but for some reason they had a desire to get into the lane im in and then slow down considerably, and if I switch lanes they'll switch as well in order to stay in front of me. I just pulled the dash cam and rear cam footage from my trip out there today and showed my gf, we counted no less than 8 instances of drivers making aggressive moves, cutting me off (whether or not intentional who knows, but it's very careless and dangerous), refusing to allow merges, etc.

Also, it seems at a number of red lights in this area, people assume you're racing them and as soon as the light turns green they high tail it out of there, even if there's a red waiting for them just ahead (at which point they'll just rev up over and over to let you know that The Race Part 2 is about to begin). And these aren't young looking angst bros who look like they still listen to Limp Bizkit and rock chain wallets. These are bald bros in Teslas, 'preppy' looking blonde jean jacket moms, big Tundra pickup dudes, etc.

There also seems to be a severe lack of courtesy, of letting other drivers through, of leaving gaps in parking lots for drivers to move through if the red light has caused a snake of cars that is blocking other lanes. There just seems to be a general dickish attitude amongst drivers out in the burbs that is largely missing from downtown. I'm not saying all drivers downtown are angels, but I drive daily in this area and often driving around here is a stress-free endeavor (if anything, tourists going too slow is the primary issue, although I'm rarely in a hurry so I don't mind if someone has the audacity to not go the speed limit).

In the Tanasbourne/Hillsboro area I also notice people have no desire to allow anyone else to merge. There are a number of streets where the 3rd lane merges into the 2nd lane and even when I'm in that 3rd lane and close to where it merges, and the 2nd lane has a line of cars that snakes back past the previous light, and I am driving slow with my left blinker on hoping someone lets me over, fucking NOBODY lets me over. I eventually had to just go and the lady held down her horn for 20 straight seconds and then drove up on my side yelling (I didnt turn my head or make eye contact).

I am really at a loss. I know lots of people are unhappy these days but we're all humans and we should at least have the courtesy and dignity of treating other people on the road the same way you'd want to be treated. I just see so much hostility and dick behavior, it's sorta stomach turning. I don't know if that's just how folks drive in the burbs, but it's pretty stressful.

I also don't mean to portray this as ""people in the burbs are terrible"". It's just that I've never experienced such a high density of raging/aggro drivers in my 2 decades in Portland as I have over the last couple of weeks making these daily trips throughout the area on Cornell between around NW150th and Orenco Station, that whole stretch that goes through Tanasbourne. I actually really like the area, lots of nice shops (and a beloved Chick-Fil-A, sorry I know I shouldn't, but that chicken is pure ambrosia), and I told my gf I could even see living out there as it seems like a pretty nice area, but the drivers out there totally ruin it.",Portland,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/lry9v2/is_it_just_me_or_does_it_feel_like_drivers_are/,2/25/2021 4:37,93,62,oregon

habwdw,More details on the Aircraft over Portland tracking your cell phones,"As stated 3 days ago in a Reddit post [""US Marshals aircraft above Portland""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/h8n0nm/us_marshalls_aircraft_above_portland/), a US Marshals plane has been flying over the demonstrations, sucking up cell-phone signals.
Those planes flying in circles are carrying special cell-phone interception hardware made by [Digital Receiver Technology, Inc.](https://www.drti.com/) (""Due to the sensitive nature of our work, we are unable to publicly advertise many of our products.""), a subsidiary of Boeing Integrated Defense Systems, which purchased it in 2008.  The device is called a Dirtbox and it can force every cell phone in a region to connect to it.

The [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/americans-cellphones-targeted-in-secret-u-s-spy-program-1415917533?tesla=y&mg=reno64-wsj) (paywall) indicates the Dirtbox systems are used by the U.S. Marshals Service, which operates Cessna aircraft.   These boxes trick your phones into silently reporting in - essentially telling the box who you are and where your are, possibly within a few feet of the phone's physical location.  To wit: if that guy who threw a firebomb had a cell phone on him, Dirtbox data may be able to pinpint and identify him to authorities.

The U.S. Marshals Service is known to loan out its stingray equipment to local police departments, as a [recent case in Sarasota, Florida shows](https://www.wired.com/2014/06/feds-seize-stingray-documents/).

Wikipedia has this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirtbox_(cell_phone).

[EFF Org Dirtbox FOIA DOJ document dump here](https://www.eff.org/cases/us-marshals-airborne-imsi-catchers).

xsfv4c,Drive Electric week this weekend. Come learn about electric vehicles and hear owner experiences.,"Local event this weekend to see electric vehicles. Great way to look at new cars without the pressure of a car dealer. Owners will be showing off their cars and happy to talk to folks about what it's like to own and the reasons for purchasing an electric vehicle. 

Details below and other events in Oregon can be found [here](https://driveelectricweek.org/event?eventid=3321).

**Fifth Lake Oswego Electric Vehicle Fair**
Sat, Oct 01 at 10:00 am - 2:00 pm PDT
Lake Oswego United Methodist Church, Lake Oswego, OR
1855 South Shore Blvd
Lake Oswego, OR 97034

This event is part of the city’s Climate Action Plan to motivate Lake Oswego residents to eliminate fossil fuel usage by shifting all of their energy needs to renewable electricity. This can include purchasing an electric vehicle (EV), replacing their space and water heaters with electric heat pumps, using an induction cook top, and installing rooftop solar panels or joining a community solar program

 Last year’s event focused only on electric vehicles and attracted more than 400 attendees. This year event with its expanded focus on going all-electric is expected to attract significantly more people.

The EV portion of the event will have numerous dealers bringing their latest EVs for test drives along with local EV owners displaying their vehicle and available to share their ownership experiences.

We anticipate that we should be seeing residents and dealers displaying some of the recently introduced EVs such as the Rivian RIT truck, Ford F-150 electric truck, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Polestar 2 along with other popular models such as Ford Mustang Mach E, GM Bolt EUV, Volkswagen ID.4 Pro and Tesla Model Y. In addition we will have a display of electric bikes and test drives in the Arcimoto Fun Utility Vehicle.

The home electrification portion of the event will feature presentations inside the Fellowship Hall on the usage and benefits of electric heat pumps, induction stoves and cooking, solar installations with battery storage along with information on how to electrify all of your landscaping equipment.

There will also be vendors with more information about each of these electrification options along with a display of the PGE Tiny Home exhibit showing how all of the elements work together.",Portland,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/xsfv4c/drive_electric_week_this_weekend_come_learn_about/,9/30/2022 23:26,36,12,oregon
16nc674,Want to learn more about electric vehicles? Check out EV car show events in your area during Drive Electric Week.,"Drive Electric Week events are community-led car shows over the next few weeks that feature electric vehicles. All will have cars on display and several events will have opportunities to test drive EVs. Test drives are the way to experience how fun it is to drive an EV. Come check out the cool cars.


The event is a great way to talk to owners. Talk to owners about what it’s like owning an EV. People who have no stake in selling a car to you. Ask questions like how much money they’ve saved driving an EV. How much of a discount does the power company give owners on electricity? What’s it like roadtripping? Learn about EV tax credits and rebates that made buying an EV worth it. With big car manufacturers turning to EVs and investing heavily in America. This is a future of automobiles. Some events will have car dealers to show cars. Better or for worst, hear the current state of EV car experiences first hand from owners.


Some folks may find EVs ridiculous with charging slower than filling up with gas. Range more limited than current available gas cars. Finding chargers to plug in too much trouble and inconvenient. The up front expense not worth it. This is a chance to see what the fuss is about.


See if EVs are right or not right for you. See this climate change action in action and drive an EV this weekend.

ng98jq,xfinity Oregon rant,"I was reluctant to choose xfinity because I had comcast before and I hated anytime having to contact them.  But there is a small section of Beaverton where my place is that doesn't have many options.  On April 1st my xfinity service started.  I immediately noticed my internet speeds were slow.  After painful online chats and phone calls to customer service where I must have restarted my modem and router like 5 times, they finally made and appointment to send a technician to my place.  

On April 4, I got a call from the technician who was outside of my house and was looking at something outside.  He was coughing on the phone.  Anytime I hear anyone coughing these days I am immediately alert.  I opened all the windows in my house.  He eventually came to my door and it was like 50 degrees outside and he looked red and was sweating.  He was breathing heavy.  I didn't put the pieces together at the time that this guy could have had Coronavirus.  Instead I thought that this guy could just have some health problems like some people do and I shouldn't act like it's a big deal.  

The guy came in and was looking at some connections and having me do some speed tests.  At some points he was within feet from me.  I tried to keep my distance.  Looking back,  I did not act very smartly.  I had my 1st covid shot 1.5 weeks before this date.  

So,  on April 10, I was in a zoom call when someone from xfinity called me and the first thing they said was ""Do you have time to take a survey about the service visit?""   I said to call me back later because I was in a meeting.  The lady then said ok,  and then she said that the technician that came to my house tested positive for Coronavirus.   And she said, ""Watch after your health.""  I asked for any more details and she said the tech went to the doctor a day after he came to me house.  So, they potentially knew for 5-6 days about it before trying to call me or anything. 

I went back to my zoom call but then my mind became befuddled about this news and I left the meeting a called xifinity back.  The major question I had was that the guy looked and sounded sick, why was out going to people's houses doing service calls?  I talked to service for a while.  They didn't have any details so the said they would get someone from the local office to call me.  I left work to go find somewhere to get a covid test (negative).  Later that afternoon,  I did get a call.  They guy from that department didn't have any answers and said they were investigating it.  And they would call me back.  

Well,  they never called me back.  It's been weeks.  I called them again about a week ago to see if they could send a reminder to them to call me.

8yn336,A tunnel and Loop to solve traffic problems between Vancouver and Portland.,"Last month Elon Musk landed in the headlines again when his tunnel-boring company won a contract to build an express service between [Chicago O’Hare International Airport and downtown Chicago](https://www.slashgear.com/elon-musks-boring-company-gets-chicago-airport-loop-contract-14534221/). While terms have not been finalized, it’s widely reported that this 18-mile project will cost “less than” or “around” a billion dollars.

Meanwhile, for almost a decade Portland has dealt with increased traffic coming from Vancouver, WA and there is no signs that this will decrease any time soon. In an effort to solve this, Oregon, Portland, Washington, and Vancouver all proposed various designs of a new “[Columbia River Crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_River_Crossing)” some type of bridge that would replace the old I-5 Bridge. In almost all proposals the price tag ranged from $2.5 billion to up to $10 billion dollars. The cities and states couldn’t agree on a number of key features, especially tolls and mixed use.

Today the conversation about tolls has restarted, but our region still needs to address building alternative infrastructure for moving people across the Columbia river. 

**What would a tunnel system look like instead of a bridge?**

Looking at a map there’s 4 obvious locations that would need to be included: 

- **Downtown Vancouver**, specifically I’m looking at Esther Short Park as it’s right off of the highway and that are is prone to high density development.

- **Pioneer Courthouse Square**, the heart of Portland’s TriMet transit system. This is the most centrally located transit spot in Portland. From here you can access any part of the city accessible through TriMet. 

- **Portland International Airport**, while the airport is currently served by MAX, it would make complete sense to have an “express” trip from Downtown to the airport, especially if that trip only took a matter of minutes.

- **Mill Plain & 205**, this is a centrally located vehicle transportation hub for almost all of East Vancouver and the area has commercial land that could be easily redeveloped. 

**These 4 locations create an [almost perfect 22-mile Triangle](https://i.imgur.com/gi15cqE.png).**

Keep in mind that this whole system doesn’t need to be underground, it is cheaper to build above ground, except in dense areas.  For the purposes of exploring this project, let’s presume it would be underground – but a real solution probably would include a mix. 

**But we still need a bridge.**

A bridge moves a lot more things than just commuters, for example, freight. Can we move freight on this system? It’s unknown, and designing a system optimized for freight is outside the scope of the Chicago project, so it’s therefore extremely difficult to make comparisons. A bridge also moves people who are going to areas outside of Metro’s core area, for example, commuting from Wilsonville or Clackamas to Vancouver. Driving will continue to be a better option for many of these people. 

Eventually we would still need a new bridge. There’s [approximately 300,000 vehicles](https://www.koin.com/news/vancouver-to-portland-commute-time-up-300_20180208091811718/960340247) that cross the Interstate bridge each day, and [87,500 workers who leave Clark County each day]( https://www.oregonmetro.gov/news/you-are-here-snapshot-how-portland-region-gets-around). This is NOT a solution for all 87,500 people or 300,000 vehicles.

**How many people could this tunnel and Loop move?**

Musk claims of his Chicago solution: “Each [vehicle] can accommodate between 8 and 16 passengers, with one leaving each station as often as every 30 seconds.” Comparatively, a highway moves about 1,900 vehicles per lane hour. When commuting, only 10% of vehicles are carpooling according to [Metro](https://www.oregonmetro.gov/news/you-are-here-snapshot-how-portland-region-gets-around), so a highway moves 2,090 people per lane hour at maximum capacity.

There’s some variables and unknowns in how Musk’s solution will *actually* work, for example, if it’s a 2-lane track, it might make more sense to go an indirect route to your destination rather than waiting in line. (In Chicago, the 18-mile journey is expected to take 12 minutes, so a 7 mile journey from downtown Vancouver to downtown Portland might take 5~6 minutes if you go direct, or might take 12-13 minutes if you go the indirect route.) In theory, a single system that has 2 opposite direction tracks could potentially move 32 to 64 people per minute, if there’s two directions you can go. In Chicago there are twin tunnels. We also don’t know how fast a multi-stop Loop system could launch new vehicles. 

The quick math on this says a highway moves 38 people in a lane per minute, Elon Musk’s solution will move 16 to 32 people in a track direction per minute. This is at peak capacity for both systems.

Here's how they stack during 2-hour rush hour peaks either, 7am-9am, 4pm-6pm… presuming there’s no traffic jam:

-	3 lane highway: 12,540 people

-	Tunnel with single-direction track Loop: 3,840 – 7,680 people. 

How does this stack up to [other transit options](https://trimet.org/ataglance/TriMet-At-a-Glance-2016.pdf)? Well, the WES hosts about 475,000 “trips” (which is 1 way) each year, by comparison a Tunnel with Loop could easily have 2 million “trips” just with commuters and easily up to 4 million if the upper-end projections hold true. C-Tran had [5.8 million](http://www.columbian.com/news/2016/jun/01/c-trans-ridership-continues-to-drop/) riders in 2015, TriMet Buses had 62.3 million trips, Max had 37.7 million trips in 2015.

**Is this more Hyperloop bullshit? That technology is totally fake, I saw a youtube video explaining why it would never work, and it’s dumb.**

No, this isn’t hyperloop. The Chicago system is kind of a hybrid: it won’t have air pressure differentials and only intends to reach a maximum speed of 150 miles per hour (not the promise of 400 miles per hour Hyperloop folks think is possible). In fact, the Chicago plan is to use a Tesla-style chassis with a very unusual 8-wheel vehicle. However, for the purposes of comparison, yeah, sure: think of it like a hyperloop-lite - or like a mono-rail, but 1-less rail! Or like a light-rail, but with lighter and smaller vehicles! Like a subway? Kinda, yeah. It’s basically very different in design from a Hyperloop, while borrowing some concepts. The Chicago solution Musk is just calling “Loop” instead of “Hyperloop.”

Though, on the topic of Hyperloop, maybe that technology will be realistic and proven. There’s [a very realistic project in Texas](https://www.chron.com/news/transportation/article/Hyperloop-first-step-flies-by-Houston-13064209.php) right now, and the [Rocky Mountain Hyperloop](https://denver.cbslocal.com/2018/05/23/hyperloop-denver-international-airport-cdot/) is now in a second phase, and [Columbus, Ohio](https://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2018/06/20/hyperloop-one-exec-i-would-bet-on-columbus.html) is fast tracking their project. Due to the shorter overall track, I don’t think Portland-Vancouver area would need a hyperloop for something like this. We could use a Hyperloop to connect Hillsboro to Vancouver to Wilsonville to Gresham. 

**But why do this? We have the Max, and I love it.**

These systems serve totally different goals. By design, light rail systems like Max provide more frequency of stops than a Loop system. Buses provide more stopping frequency than light rail. In transportation, maximum speed is really determined by the frequency of stops, and this system would have only a limited number of stops, the less the better. This system would also be separated from street traffic and able to travel at higher speeds than Max ever could.  

This system wouldn’t replace light rail or buses, it would be a totally new layer of transit that exists for a wholly different purpose.  

A solution like this operating at peak capacity reinvents how transit patterns can work. For example, if you live in East Portland and you want to get downtown, it might be a lot easier to commute to the Airport, then take the Loop downtown. If you’re at the Oregon Convention Center and you want to get to the Airport, it still might make sense to ride the Red Line. 

Indeed, we do need a solution like this. We need a bridge too. We need light rail in Vancouver. We need to expand CTRAN’s bus system. 

**The Chicago solution is going to charge $20 to $25 per trip. No one is going to pay that.**

That is pretty darn expensive. Consider that currently people in Vancouver pay $10~$20 to park in downtown Portland each day already, and they’re waiting in traffic for 30 minutes, and right now we don’t know how Tolls will impact people. While $25 seems absurd, there’s probably ways to reduce this overall cost here in Portland. This Chicago system has a rather unique funding model where Musk’s company is fronting the money for the whole thing, and keeping money from the systems transit fees, advertisements, and in-vehicle sales. Elon Musk’s company hasn’t disclosed why they expect $20 to $25 fees, nor if they think those fees are enough to pay for maintenance and capital costs, or how soon they want to pay off the capital costs. 

All transit receives some types of subsidies, and the fares you pay to enter TriMet don’t truly cover anywhere close to TriMet’s operating budget. For example, the [2019](https://trimet.org/budget/) budget is $710 million in operating expenses (that doesn’t include debts or capital), and only about $100 million comes from the $2.50 fares, and $300 million comes from business taxes, Oregon and the Feds kick in the rest. TriMet also operates expensive boondoggles like WES, which cost a TriMet [$15 per rider](https://www.oregonlive.com/commuting/index.ssf/2016/05/trimet_wants_to_buy_used_train.html) and which we charge only $2.50.

A Portland project could have very different funding systems, and therefore different operating and capital expenses. Realistically, if we could get a round-trip cost $15, and charge people $5 for parking in Vancouver, I believe a lot of commuters would stomach that cost. If the Federal government pays for a portion of this project, if Washington and Oregon kicks in money… Maybe, just maybe, we can bring the cost down to a level commuters will pay for.

**This is all bullshit. These costs make no sense and you’re just making up these numbers!**

Right. I’m just looking at a project in Chicago that has very loose numbers, lots of private speculation, and hasn’t even broken ground yet. This Chicago project might become a financial disaster, it might get wrapped up in red tape like the California Highspeed Rail and never become a reality. No denying these numbers could be all off.  

If you want a string of criticisms about the Chicago project, check out [this City Lab article which is just seething with the anti-Musk rhetoric](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/06/for-1-billion-elon-musks-tunnel-to-ohare-would-be-a-miracle/562841/) you’re looking for. They claim basically none of this is possible, unproven, it’s not a commuter service (so, why bother?) and yada yada yada. 

Regardless of what we do or do not do, other global cities will move forward with this technology. We’ll see how it develops. I’m optimistic that Musk will yet again pull off some crazy idea and I started to think how this technology could be brought to Portland, and in theory what it could look like. I was surprised to see that a simplistic overall track with 4 stops isn’t substantially larger or longer than this Chicago system. 

All of us need to think radically outside the box, as bike lanes and buses are not solving our problems in the future. 

**But isn’t this system incredibly dangerous? Have you heard about the earthquake? We can’t do tunnels.**

Regardless of what the paranoid paramilitary lunatics over at /r/CascadianPreppers might claim about earthquakes, there’s actually few safety concerns. Hyperloop engineers were pelted with questions during a [reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6sgfe7/were_mostly_engineers_at_hyperloop_one_and_were/) and none of them expressed concerns with quakes – in fact one official respondent wrote, “Tunnels have the advantage of allowing us to select more direct routes and they usually perform better in earthquakes than above-ground structures.” All the same, there’s safety considerations for a tunnel and I’m sure the Chicago project will demonstrate how they work as this project moves closer to reality. Certainly a project in the pacific northwest would be conscious of earthquake resiliency – perhaps that’s a reason why we should build this.

Interesting question about the vibrancy of smaller cities in the cutthroat global economy.  

from the article:

>If you're a person with global-scale ambition, you move to either New York or Silicon Valley.

> There's a lot of truth to this version of the statement. Think about the egos and the ambition of the people in Silicon Valley. People like Thiel (Paypal, Palantir, others), Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook), and Travis Kalanick (Uber) practically define Silicon Valley. In New York, think about the incredible ambition of a Michael Bloomberg or a Donald Trump—two radically different people to be sure, but both extremely ambitious.

> How many of these kinds of people live anywhere in the U.S. outside those two cities? A few. You can think of Bill Gates (Microsoft) and Jeff Bezos (Amazon) in Seattle. Or Elon Musk (Tesla, Space X, et. al) who lives in L.A. But there aren't many. It's telling that Mark Zuckerberg started at Harvard and moved to the Valley. It's similar for Mark Andreessen (Netscape) and many others before them.

> The bottom line is that the ambition level in Silicon Valley and New York is simply off the charts. That kind of ambition is not what you find in Chicago (or pretty much anywhere else). It can exist from time to time—think Barack Obama—but is a big anomaly.

13xrb0r,TriMet's problems are exponentially worse than anyone is talking about,"Public opinion of TriMet's decisions have been pretty mixed, mostly because TriMet's decisions are so convoluted that they can be a real challenge to understand. In reality, Metro and Portlanders need to have a bigger civic conversation about the future of TriMet, looking at the big picture. We have 3 looming existential crises of TriMet to be concerned about that are bigger than revenue dips, crime, or homeless people.
 
Civic leaders and the public are focused on a quick ""fix"" for TriMet revenue drops - even though we've seen this coming for a long time, it's very predictable that TriMet's Board of Directors acts at the last minute. Also, very predictably, TriMet's Board opted for a fare increase because over the previous 20 years that's been a go-to answer to every problem (except for that one time they killed Fareless Square). The politically appointed boards of TriMet and Metro lack the unique specialized knowledge of the issues I'll bring up here. If TriMet knows about these larger issues, they're obviously burring it from public view. In the short term, increasing fares is like putting fresh paint on a house that's on fire; in this situation, that paint is HIGHLY flammable.
 
First - fare hikes as a tactic is a brain-dead move. Just the most utterly stupid and self-sabotaging response to a looming budget shortfall. I'm dwelling on this because it illustrates their terrible decision-making, which is functional proof they have no idea what they're doing. Some of the core reasons for this:
 
- Increasing fares reduces utilization. Higher cost means fewer people ride, which will decrease the ridership revenue. It will also marginally increase the number of people who won't pay (funny story, *some* of those who don't pay actually can't afford to). TriMet isn't a monopoly or inelastic service, and plenty of other choices exist that didn't exist 20 years ago: an actual bike share, scooters, electric bikes, Uber/Lyft, shared vehicles, and more bike paths. Before the pandemic, it was common that I would bus into downtown for work and then take a Lyft home because it wasn't all that expensive, like $8 more than a bus ride - TriMet's price increases make a system that wasn't very competitive simply less compelling.
 
- Across Portland we need to go through a process of austerity and downsizing government. I absolutely support Wheeler putting a pause on rate increases, but for God's sake, we have far too much largesse in every layer of government. If you need to learn what I'm talking about, read my old article on [Parks & Rec](https://fidelitypdx.substack.com/p/wheres-the-evidence-that-portland). So many divisions/agencies have doubled their staff while reducing service levels. It's bonkers. Cutting throats needs to be an imperative. This is because the great majority of public sector employees in Oregon and Portland are incompetent, redundant, and only exist because Oregon and Portland have been reluctant to use automation. And I don't mean the cutting-edge AI stuff, I'm talking about people who still handle business processes as if they're *paper forms*. I could tell so many stories from my professional experience - but you'll have to take my word for it for now: culling this bureaucracy is the right move, and until there's a significant downsizing, the political class is taking none of the financial crisis or cost of living situation seriously.
 
- TriMet's operating budget/revenue is primarily Payroll Taxes, not passenger revenue. About 20-30% of TriMet's budget comes from people buying fares, whereas the bulk of money TriMet needs comes from payroll taxes that businesses pay directly. Because of this, transit activists (including myself) have been proponents of increasing the payroll taxes marginally to make TriMet free for riders. Of course, fareless transit comes with a wide variety of new and different problems (*that's an article for another time*). Still, when you understand that only a sliver of revenue comes from fares, increasing the fare simply results in a marginal increase in revenue. The much bigger problem is going to businesses investing outside of Metro, and changing workforces that 1) won't pay payroll taxes reliably, 2) don't need people to go into the office. Think about the longer-term game here: is TriMet's board going to increase fares as utilization drops and payroll taxes continually diminish? (See my point above about how their default answer is ""yes"" because it's the only politically expedient answer.)
 
Reading comments about the fare hikes, most of the public thinks TriMet is dealing with a safety or utilization issue. Both of these are 100% true: soft-on-crime progressives have wholly obliterated the working class perception of TriMet safety - there are so many different ways this has happened, but we should thank so many people in the media and political class: Ana del Rocio's crying wolf about racism in fare inspections (and the media entertaining it), or Mike Schmidt deinstitutionalizing of the justice system, or Legislature's inability to act on the massive mental health crisis and drug addiction crisis in Oregon. No matter the underlying cause, we have a system where deranged violent mentally ill tweakers can be disruptive on the train, but working-class people face a $250 fine if they can't afford a ~~$2.50~~ ($2.80) ticket. TriMet is less safe, especially the light rail and bus lines. We could hypothetically talk about various policy and infrastructure changes, such as turnstiles and security guards - but pragmatically, this won't do shit when our society has adopted a philosophy of transforming the urban core into an open-air insane asylum and opened the doors to the prisons. This safety issue is well beyond TriMet's scope, and even if there was consensus among TriMet and Metro to solve this, the entire justice system and Legislature is still broken.
 
##**Fare Hikes and Utilization is the Red Herring - Let's talk about TriMet's future**
 
In reality, multiple design choices made decades ago set us up for failure. But we also have to thank brain-dead progressive lunatics and corrupt politicos who have steered our transit decision-making into the ground.
 
There are three specific issues I'm going to talk about, with each becoming more consequential and disastrous for TriMet:
 
- Hub and Spoke Design and the need for a redesign of the entire system to fit new commuting/transit patterns
 
- Portland Light Rail's short cars are a capacity problem not worth the price tag to fix
 
- Autonomous vehicles are here, and it's just going to get worse for TriMet
 
##**The strategic design of TriMet's system is broken, and it's been broken before.**
 
If you looked at a map of TriMet's bus and rail system, you'd see a design pattern often referred to as a ""Radial Design"" or sometimes a ""Hub And Spoke"" design. The Hub and Spoke strategy is building our transit system around centralized locations to connect to other routes. For Portland the idea is to go downtown (or sometimes a Park and Ride) where you can connect to your next destination. This is why the majority of bus routes and all the max routes go downtown, to our Transit Mall and Pioneer Square.
 
Downtown planning was a smart idea in the 1960s when it was coupled with Main Street economic theory and prototype urban development zones - all of this wrapped up in the 1972 Downtown Plan policy. During these decades, the primary economic idea of urban revitalization was that downtown cores could provide better business climates and shopping districts that amplify economic activity synergistically. In other words, packing all the office jobs and luxury shopping in one area is good for workers, business, and civic planning.
 
All very smart ideas in yester-year, so TriMet became focused on serving the downtown business community myopically. This myopia became so paramount that it was considered illegitimate (actually taboo, borderline illegal) if you used a Park & Ride facility to park and NOT ride downtown. Amanda Fritz once explained that we couldn't expand Barbur Transit Center because that would result in students parking at Barbur Transit Center and riding the bus to PCC Sylvania. This view implies that TriMet exists only to service downtown workers, not the students, not the impoverished mom needing to go to a grocery store.
 
How does TriMet's hub and spoke design represent its purpose?
 
Portland's unspoken rule of transit philosophy is that jobs pay for the system (remember, business payroll taxes pay for most of it), so TriMet should be focused on serving people utilizing it for their job - employers pay for it, and they get value out of it. But this is both unspoken (never said aloud) and largely unobserved. The whole idea of TriMet as a social service to serve low-income people, to help impoverished people - well, those ideas were just lukewarm political rhetoric that is tossed out as soon as some *Undesirable* with tattered clothing reeking of cigarettes gets aboard - then Portlanders jump right back ""this is for workers only!"" Sadly, there hasn't ever been a public consensus of why TriMet exists because I could equally argue that TriMet's purpose isn't serving the working class; it's actually vehicle emissions reductions - but here, too, reality contradicts that this is the purpose for why we operate TriMet. TriMet's real purpose seems to be ""Spend money on lofty capital projects"" and if we want to be cynical about it, we can elaborate ""*…because large capital projects enable grift, embezzlement, and inflating property values for developers.*""
 
We haven't always depended upon a hub and spoke design. A great article from Jarrett Walker written in 2010 on his Human Transit blog explains in ""[The Power and Pleasure of Grids](https://humantransit.org/2010/02/the-power-and-pleasure-of-grids.html)""
 
> Why aren't all frequent networks grids? The competing impulse is the radial network impulse, which says: ""We have one downtown. Everyone is going there, so just run everything to there."" Most networks start out radial, but some later transition to more of a grid form, often with compromises in which a grid pattern of routes is distorted around downtown so that many parallel routes converge there. You can see this pattern in many cities, Portland for example. Many of the lines extending north and east out of the city center form elements of a grid, but converge on the downtown. Many other major routes (numbered in the 70s in Portland's system) do not go downtown, but instead complete the grid pattern. This balance between grid and radial patterns was carefully constructed in 1982, replacing an old network in which almost all routes went downtown.
 
Over the years the grid pattern was neglected in favor of a downtown-focused investment strategy. To a real degree it made practical sense: that's where the jobs were. But again, this is the presumption that TriMet and Mass Transit ought to service workers first, and there's not much consensus on that. But while we can't decide on TriMet's purpose, we can absolutely agree on one important thing: ***Downtown is dead.***
 
No 5-star hotel is going to fix it. (As of writing, I'm not even convinced that this mafia-connected bamboozle of public fraud will open.) No ""tough-on-crime"" DA to replace Mike Schmidt, like Nathan Vasquez, will fix downtown. It's not JUST a crime problem: most of the problems we deal with today mirror the problems facing Portland in the 1960s, especially our inability to invest in good infrastructure people actually want to use. That's on top of crime, vandalism, and an unhealthy business ecosystem.
 
***IF*** we want to maintain TriMet (and that's a big IF, for reasons I'll explain below), then it will be focused on something other than downtown. We need to move back to a grid-design transit system, as this is a much easier way to use transit to get around the city, no matter your destination. If TriMet continues to exist and operate fleets in 20-30 years, this is the only way it exists - because it will just be too inconvenient to ride downtown as a side quest to your destination, especially as we look at 10, 20, 30, 40 years from now.
 
Of course, we can only transform some parts of the transit infrastructure this way, and there are no uplifting and moving train tracks here. So light rail doesn't have a future in the grid system - but even without the grid system, light rail is doomed.
 
##**The fatal flaws of light rail in Portland.**
 
I want to preface this by saying *I like light rail as a strategy*, it's not a bad system or bad civic investment. I could write another 5,000-word essay on why Seattle did an excellent job with light rail and the specific decisions Portland made wildly incorrectly. In transit advocacy the wacktavists inappropriately categorized skeptics of Portland's light rail as some soft bigotry - as if you're racist if you don't like Portland's light rail - even though, ironically, most light rail systems tend to be built for the preference of white culture and white workers, precisely what happened here in Portland and most cities (but this is all a story for another time).
 
**Portland's light rail system has a capacity problem and has dealt with this capacity problem quietly for the last 20+ years.** When you see the capacity problem, you can quickly understand this light rail system won't work in the future. All the other smart cities in the world that designed light rail realized they needed big long trains to move many people. Portland decided to limit the train car length to the size of our city blocks to save construction costs - and this has always been a fatal flaw.
 
Portland's highest capacity train car is our Type 5, [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TriMet_rolling_stock) it has a seating capacity of 72 and an overall capacity of 186 per ~~train~~ *car, meaning each train can accommodate up to 372, but even these numbers seem unreliable* (*edit). Let's compare:
 
- Washington DC has 6-car trains capable of carrying 120 passengers per car, or 720 per train.
 
- Salt Lake City has a 4-car train capable of carrying 230 passengers per car, or 920 per train.
 
- Seattle's Link system has a 3 or 4-car train, each capable of carrying approximately 200 passengers per car, so 600 to 800 per train.
 
Portland's light rail lines have roughly the same people moving capacity as *a single lane* of a highway, maybe marginally more, maybe marginally less. These other cities have a light rail system that can move the same amount of people *as an entire 3-lane highway.* 
 
You might suspect that Portland could simply run trains more frequently - but nah, that's impossible because the trains run through the central core of downtown Portland, and they're blocked by the real interfaces with road traffic and bottlenecks. TriMet/PBOT/Metro has offered rosy ideas that we could hypothetically run cars every 90 seconds, 2 minutes, 4 minutes, or 6 minutes (depending upon who you ask) - but these are garbage numbers invented out of thin air. For example, you could stand at Pioneer Courthouse Square at 4:50pm on a Wednesday in 2016 - there was a train opening doors to load passengers, and you could visibly see the next train at Pioneer Place Mall pulling into the station behind. Trains were running at approximately a 3 to 4 minute at peak - but on paper, TriMet will claim anything, as they don't give a shit about lying to the public. But the bigger problem is that **trains were full.** You might have to wait 90 minutes to find a train that offers a seat. And god forbid you had a bike.
 
I'm not making this very real capacity problem, [Metro even acknowledges](https://www.oregonmetro.gov/max-tunnel-study):
 
> At the busiest hours of the day, 40 light rail trains must cross the river and traverse downtown – one train every 90 seconds. As the region grows and the demand for light rail increases, the region will need at least 64 MAX trains through downtown every hour, more than one train each minute. Our current system can't support that change.
 
Suppose you're silly enough to trust government propaganda. In that case, you can read [the details of Metro study on this in 2019](https://www.oregonmetro.gov/sites/default/files/2019/10/25/MAX%20Tunnel%20Study%20Findings.pdf). If we assumed their numbers added up, it's just fucking impossible to run 62 trains per hour, because passenger loading and unloading can take a full minute (sometimes longer). So unless we want to apply substantial g-forces onto the passengers, the train isn't accelerating out of the stops fast enough. Not to mention how unreliable this whole system would be if a sole tweaker, bike rider, or person with a stroller held up the system for 2 minutes.
 
This is why the bottom line needs to be upfront about capacity - quoting Metro's study here:
 
> ***Today MAX is limited to 2-car trains because of the length of downtown city blocks. A tunnel could allow for longer trains if the stations outside the downtown core are retrofitted***. In the long-term, this could greatly increase MAX capacity.
 
Do you see that trick? Build a tunnel, yes - but the entire system has to be retrofitted. Literally every light rail station would need to be redesigned, the lines themselves recalculated for larger heavier trains - and extending platforms at Willow Creek might be simple enough, but how in the living fuck is Metro going to afford to expand the Zoo stop? Doubling the size of that platform would cost $500 million alone.
 
If the city weren't full of cheap dipshits, we would have elevated or buried our light rail lines in the 1980s or 90s, enabling longer train cars to run. Yes, we all knew back then that it was the best practice not to have light rail running on the street - it's less safe, less reliable, runs slower, and limits train car size. *Oops.*
 
Just to keep TriMet's own bullshit inflated utopian vision, it would mean spending another billion dollars just to unfuck downtown, bypass an aging bridge, and potentially allow a marginally higher volume of trains - which again is a band-aid on a mortal wound.
 
The real buried lede is that **to add extra train cars means retrofitting all the stops in the system** - that's ***tens of billions of dollars***. You can argue costs, but Metro knows we need to do this. It means shutting down the system for a year or years while construction and retrofits happen. It's fucking outrageous. Is this system worth of people per line worth 20, 30, or 40 billion dollars? Fuck no, it ain't. Again, if we had a raging metropolis of industry and commerce downtown, we could reasonably entertain the idea for a moment - but we don't and never will again.
 
Some folks might argue that if we kill off the light rail system we'd lose out on all those lucrative Transit Oriented Developments. Originally the public was told that Transit Oriented Development strategy would cause a massive infusion of private investment because the light rail was so damn lucrative and desirable for Richard Florida's Creative Class. Turns out the Creative Class is now called today the Laptop Class, and they don't give a flying fuck about street cars, light rail, or walking scores - because most can't be bothered to put pants on during their ""commute"" from bed to desk. TOD was all a fantasy illusion from the beginning, as multiple studies about Portland commuters showed that college-educated white folks riding Max were equally comfortable riding their bike as a substitute for the same commute. All of these billions of dollars was to accommodate white fare-weather bikers. So here's my hot take on transit: pave over the rail lines and put in bike lanes, and boy, then you'd have a bike system to give folks like Maus a hardon. But of course, Bike Portland would complain because their focus isn't biking; they exist only to favor all poorly thought utopian transit ideas.
 
Another group of Max/TOD advocates would claim that TOD is better for disabled and impoverished people. And yeah, there's truth there, but see my entire argument above about the Hub & Spoke design of TriMet being the antithesis of transit as a social service. If you believe that TriMet should serve low-income people, you must advocate for a bus-centric grid design.
 
But even if you're a die-hard believer in light rail - there's another inevitable reality coming that is the nail in the coffin.
 
##**Autonomous vehicles will replace mass transit faster than the automobile replaced the horse.**
 
I work in advanced technology, and the thing about tech is that the public and politicians deny that it's going to be there until the majority of the public finally experiences it. You could say this about personal computers, internet, cloud compute, electric cars, smartphones, distributed ledger (cryptocurrency), AI, and driverless vehicles.
 
Schrodinger's technology doesn't exist until it's measured in an Apple store or your mother asks you for tech support.
 
No one thought AI *was really* real until ChatGPT did their kid's homework, and today most people are coming to terms with the fact that ChatGPT 3.5 could do most people's jobs. And that's not even the most advanced AI, that's the freeware put out by Microsoft, they have paywalls to access the real deal.
 
In 2018 I rode in my colleague's Tesla in self-driving mode from downtown Portland to Top Golf in Hillsboro. We started our journey at the surface parking lot on the west side of the Morrison Bridge. He used his phone to tell the car to pull out of the parking spot and to pick us up. Then he gave the car the address, and it drove us the entire way without any human input necessary. The only time he provided feedback was to touch the turn signal to pass a slow car on the highway. People think self-driving isn't here - but it is - and it's gotten exponentially better and will continue to do so. People will complain and moan about idealized, utopian, pedantic ""level 5"" full self-driving, how none of it exists or could exist, as a Tesla passes them on the road and the driver is half asleep.
 
Of course, Portland and every major city have also thought deeply about self-driving technology, and a few places have implemented self-driving solutions - but so far, none of these are really at scale. Though it will be a short time before cost-conscious cities go all-in.
 
TriMet kicked around the idea of using an autonomous bus for a leg of the trip of the Southwest Corridor project, connecting a segment of the light rail route to the community college. It was bafflingly stupid and short-sighted to think they could use it in this niche application but that it wouldn't open the floodgates for a hundred different applications that eviscerate TriMet's labor model. The simplest example of autonomous operation would be to operate the light rail systems - because they don't make turns, all we need is an AI vision service to slam on the breaks if necessary - that technology has existed for 20+ years. We could retrofit the entire train system in about 3 to 6 months - replace every Max operator with a security guard, and maybe people would ride the Max again? But I digress.
 
**Let's speculate about the far-future, some 5, 10, or 20 years from now:** your transit options will expand significantly. The cost will decrease considerably for services using automated vehicles.
 
You'll look at your options as:
 
- **Drive to work:** fastest, takes $100+ worth of gas a month, but you also need $50+ for insurance and $500+ for the monthly car payment, plus those surprise maintenance and broken windows. Also, do you pay for parking? Pick a number for how much it costs to drive your personally owned and manually operated vehicle to work each month. 
 
- **Autonomous vehicle service:** price TBA, but think of how much an Uber costs when you don't have to pay the driver, you don't have to pay for gas. An Uber that runs for $20 today would likely be $10 or less. So, to and from work 20 times a month, $200. $300? Ok, let's just say it's $400 a month. *It's still all cheaper than owning a car and driving it to work.* No parking fees, and it picks you up quickly enough that it's not a nuisance.
 
- **Mass Transit:** $150 per month, but ugghhh it's slow, it smells like piss, a guy jacked off in your hair, and you can't schedule a meeting for the first 30 minutes of your anticipated workday in case you miss a connection - and it breaks so often the government actively hides the reliability data from the public and media.
 
Just a few years into this future we'll see a brand new trend, one that already exists: a shared autonomous vehicle like a privately operated bus. For example, Uber Bus - it already exists as a commuter option in some cities, it's just not autonomous yet. The significant benefit of an autonomous bus is that these shared vehicles will utilize HOV lanes very commonly, and commuting in an autonomous vehicle will be as fast as driving to work in your manually operated car while also being less expensive.
 
Simultaneously automobile accidents in autonomous vehicles will be virtually non-existent, and insurance companies will start to increase prices on vehicles that lack AI/smart assisted safety driving features. Public leaders will see the value of creating lanes of traffic on highways dedicated explicitly to autonomous vehicles so that they can drive at much higher speeds than manually operated traffic. Oregon won't lead the way here, but wait until Texas or one of the Crazy States greenlights a speed limit differential, and self-driving vehicles have a speed limit of 90, 120, or 150 miles per hour. You might think ""accidents would be terrible and deadly"" but there will be fewer accidents in the autonomous lane than in manual lanes. At this point, it will be WAY faster to take an autonomous vehicle to your work.
 
Purchasing power of consumers will decrease while the cost of vehicles will increase (especially autonomous vehicles), making ownership of any vehicle less likely. Frankly, the great majority of people won't know how to drive and will never learn to - just like how young people today don't know how to use manual transmission. However, fleets of autonomous vehicles owned by companies like Tesla, Uber, and Lyft will benefit from scale and keep their autonomous bus fleets operating at low cost. This will lead to a trend where fewer and fewer people will own an automobile, and fewer people even bother learning how to drive or paying the enormous insurance cost.... while also depending upon automobiles more than we do today. 
 
Eventually, in the distant future, manually driven vehicles will be prohibited in urban areas as some reckless relic from a bygone era.
 
Cities and public bodies don't have to be cut out of this system if they act responsibly. For example, cities could start a data brokering exchange where commuters provide their commuting data (i.e., pick-up point, destination, arrival time). The government uses either a privatized fleet or a publicly owned fleet of autonomous vehicles to move as many people as possible as often as possible. Sort of a publicly run car-pool list - or a hyper-responsive bus fleet that runs for the exact passengers going to exact locations. A big problem companies like Uber, Lyft, and Tesla will have is that they'll lack market saturation to optimize commuting routes - they'll be able to win unique rides, but the best way they can achieve the lowest cost service model is these super predictable and timely commuter riders. The more data points and riders, the more optimization they can achieve. These companies can look at the data for as many people as possible and bid for as many routes as possible - optimizing for convenience, time, energy usage, emissions, etc. The public will voluntarily participate if this is optimized to get the cheapest ride possible. If the government doesn't do this, the private sector will eventually. 
 
As a parallel, no one today even considers how Metro runs garbage collection. No one cares. And if you didn't like Metro's trash service, if you needed a better service for unique needs, you go procure that on your own. Likewise, you wouldn't care about the quality of the commuting trip as long as it's up to some minimal standards of your class expectations, it's reliable, nearly as quick as driving your own vehicle, and it seems reasonably affordable. 
 
If the public ran this data exchange, fees could subsidize lower-income riders. This is a theory on what a TriMet like system or mass transit system could look like in a primarily autonomous world where most people don't own their own or drive an automobile. 
 
This system would be far from perfect, opening up all sorts of problems around mobility. However, it's hard to see how autonomous vehicles will not obliterate the value proposition of mass transit. 

##**Another narrative on the same story.**

As the working class moves to autonomous vehicles, transit agencies will collect fewer and fewer fares - prices and taxes will rise, creating a cycle of failure. As a result, some cities will make buses self-driving to cut costs. It could start with Tokyo, Shanghai, Oslo, et al. Again, it's unlikely that Portland or Oregon will be the first movers on this, but when cities start laying off hundreds of mass transit operators and cutting fares to practically nothing, there will be substantial public pressure to mimic locally. It will be *inhumane*, it will be *illiberal*, to make those impoverished bus-riding single mothers pay premiums. As most of the fleet becomes autonomous, responsive, and disconnected from labor costs, the next question arises: why do we still operate bus routes? Why big buses instead of smaller and nimble vehicles? 

This alternative story/perspective leads to the same outcome: we figure out where people are going and when they need to get there - then dispatch the appropriate amount of vehicles to move that exact number of people as efficiently as possible. 
 
But our local government getting its act together on all this is outside the world of possibility.

In a practical sense, we're going to see history repeat itself. Portland's mass transit history is about private and public entities over-extending themselves, getting too deep in debt on a flawed and outdated idea. As a result, the system collapses into consolidation or liquidation. Following this historical pattern, TriMet/Metro won't respond to changing conditions fast enough, and laughably stupid ideas like cranking up taxes or increasing ridership fares will continue to be the only option until the media finally acknowledges these groups are insolvent. I just hope we don't spend tens of billions of dollars propping up this zombie system before we can soberly realize that we made some mistakes and these vanity-laden projects 20 and 30 years ago need to die. 
 
You see, the biggest flaw with TriMet isn't the design, it needs to be outpaced by technology, it's that the people making decisions at TriMet and Metro are going to make the politically expedient decisions, not the right decisions. They won't redesign, and they won't leverage technology for cost savings, so this charade will just get going along until the media simply declares they're insolvent.

Back to fares for a second - the media happily reprints TriMet's horseshit take about ""[The higher fares will bring in an estimated $4.9 million in annual revenue starting next year, the report says.](https://www.opb.org/article/2023/05/24/trimet-fare-increase/)"" Just sort of amazing to me there's no skepticism about this number - but most spectacular is no media considerations about alternative solutions. For example, I could tell TriMet how to save [$9,548,091](https://trimet.org/about/pdf/trimetridership.pdf) next year - a useless program primarily utilized by white middle-class folks who own alternative methods of transport - and this would inconvenience way less transit-dependent people than raising fares. But, that's off the table - we're not even developing a decision matrix for when we kill the blackhole of money known as WES.",PortlandOR,https://www.reddit.com/r/PortlandOR/comments/13xrb0r/trimets_problems_are_exponentially_worse_than/,6/1/2023 19:45,48,48,oregon

Fallout from some Portland crap:

*On the night of Saturday, June 24, 2023, Ben Brody was in Riverside, California.*   

*About 1,000 miles away, a gay pride event was being held near  Portland, Oregon. In recent years, the city has become a flashpoint for  often violent clashes over the country’s ongoing culture wars.*    

*It was no great surprise then that the event became a target for  rival far-right groups and neo-Nazis who began fighting among themselves  while protesting. Video of the skirmish, where the far-right protesters  pushed and pulled at each other, quickly spread across social media.*   

*Online conspiracy theorists soon jumped into the fray.*    

*Rather than accept the fact that two far-right groups who have  previously embraced violence were responsible for the clash, online  trolls insisted it must be a so-called “false flag” event – a set-up of  some kind to make the neo-Nazis look bad.*

Don’t let anybody tell you protesting doesn’t matter. Screw those comments from the cheap seats. It’s the person who gets in the arena that counts! It’s time to channel Teddy Roosevelt across the board here!

We don’t know what impact it will have on this administration, but as active citizens we know the impact it has on us and that matters too! It’s an outlet for connection, a place to vent frustrations, and it’s important to get that energy moving up and out of us! Go yell your face off! I promise you’ll feel better, and that will help keep us in the fight. Make no mistake, this moment is asking us to fight back. This moment requires us to show up and give even a little bit of what our past generations did to keep this country whole. 

America is not perfect. God knows. But maybe this is an opportunity to begin to be honest and rectify the past. This administration is a boil coming to the surface resulting from a past built on many infected ideas and practice. And we are all feeling the fester.

However, after floating this to friends, I've heard anecdotally of issues with the batteries of EVs through Bend cold winters.  One friend repeated an anecdote that their friends sold their Tesla because it couldn't reliably make the round trip from Pronghorn to Bend.  Naturally that's even less range than what I'd need.

I know that EV batteries suffer from cold overnights/days, but if I plugin at work and at home does that mitigate the issues?  Love to hear from others with direct experience.",Bend,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bend/comments/nt2ayu/tesla_battery_performance_in_cold_bend/,6/5/2021 18:38,5,32,oregon

1jix5vl,Latest Ramblings of the Odem Medo Theater Owners,"Latest install of the ramblings of the owner of the Odem Medo Theater. He sends these out to anyone who’s booked a ticket online. Voting with my wallet by not going to that theater anymore. Their food sucks anyway and the place is filthy. The health inspector should really take a visit.

“Down in Arizona and trying to whip this puppy out so I can get some stuff done out on the property. I told Frank Morrow the realtor that tries to keep the train on the tracks down here that Keri and I were going to a John Fogerty concert. Frank reminded me, you know he is a liberal one. I responded that if I had to agree with the politics of the court jesters that entertain me, I would never get entertained. Fogerty, like a good liberal, went right to bashing Musk and Tesla. I am thinking as he is just ripping Musk with mindless barbs now that Tesla has come so far replacing the gas engine. Musk was the darling of the left because he was the first person to make a viable alternative to the internal combustion engine. Climate change an existential threat to mankind lol. Now, not so much .As Keri and I were driving home I threw it out there, will we all look back at 2025 as the day the climate warriors all committed Hara-kiri to protest Elon Musk. What a wild world we are living in.I know I teased a greatest hits email from the pandemic but am so far behind so will put it off until I can do it justice.

Back to the business of showing films. I learned something this week about Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes as it related to Snow White. Looking through the user reviews they were were mostly 1 or 2 stars. I looked at Metacritic and they were at a 1.2 out of ten. Terrible. So Rotten Tomatoes only gives a score on people that post an audience review that has purchased a ticket on Fandango. No conflict of interest here, Fandango owns Rotten Tomatoes. So that is just a small percentage of the movie tickets sold for a film and that makes it really meaningless. So yeah, I guess really Rotten Tomatoes is, well, pretty worthless in that regard. The real world experience with Snow White is Disney is going to lose a lot of money. We had an ok weekend but still took the prime 6:30 show down Sunday because of a lack of interest.

On the positive side, we have A Working Man up for next weekend with Odem favorite Jason Statham and selling tickets for the preview Thursday, which always makes for a good start. Actually, almost all shows have pre sales next weekend so that's great.We want to book A Minecraft Movie for the following weekend but need A Working Man to out gross Snow White this weekend. So come on out and help the Odem by watching A Working man. I have added a few more films down below to give you guys a heads up on what we are hoping to book. We have the Account 2 with Ben Affleck for April 25th in the cue and it already is at 84% with the critics. We expect to follow with the new Marvel Thunderbolts which actually looks good for a change. Going to try to go off the reservation May 9th and see if we can book Nic Cage in the Surfer for May 9th, a week after it comes out. It is already at 87% on the reviews and looks like a real physiological thriller. So that takes us out 8 weeks of wish list without box office tracking so we will see how it goes.

I get back late Wednesday and will be jonesing to bet back to the Odem. Expect real visual progress on the building project outside the next 30 days. We had longtime customer Jake Vernam from Vernam crane service out to dial in how we are going to get the walls lifted into position and expect to start framing the south wall by the end of the week.

Once I get back, expect an email on the first three sections of our constitution. Section on Article I of the constitution which is congress, Article II which is the executive (President) and Article III the supreme court. All about the separation of power and the founding fathers. The local judges, District Judges have zero power from the constitution. Congress created them in 1789 and they can not rule on the article II powers of the Executive. That is not even vested in the Supreme Court in Article III which gave them original jurisdiction over disputes with ambassadors and ministers of the government. These local judges are going to have to have their wings clipped. The reality is the Supreme Court has no power except what congress and the executive branch lets them have. Congress controls the purse strings, the executive branch controls the army and foreign policy as well as the federal government. If we look back in history to Andrew Jackson after the Supreme Court decision that told the state of Georgia to back down and protect the Cherokee Nation's sovereignty in Georgia. Georgia did not agree and Jackson is said to have said, ""John Marshall has his decision, let him enforce it."" The supreme court could not and the Cherokee Nation was banished from Georgia in what we all know today as the Trail of Tears. More next week about all of this and the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and what is a country and what is a nation.

17fj9h4,What car should I buy?,"My husband (35M) and I (31F) are gearing up for an upcoming job transfer and relocation to Bend next year, and we’re looking to buy a new car that’s better suited to the winters there. 

(For context: We’re a dentist and PA living in Medford, OR currently. We happily drive a paid-off 2001 Toyota Corolla and a 2008 Honda Fit lolol. ✌🏽)

Since we’re hoping to build a family in the next few years I’ve been looking at either a SUV with 3rd row seating or a minivan that can comfortably fit 7 + a dog. Other specs I’m looking for include: AWD and long-term reliability as I plan to drive this into the ground lol. Also something that is good for driving thru forest roads/hiking trails/up Mt. Bachelor for snowboarding season. Budget is ~$30-50k and I’m okay with used/older models.

So far my list includes: 
- Toyota Highlander
- Honda Pilot
- Subaru Ascent
- Toyota Sienna
- Mazda CX-9

Would love to hear your input and experience with any of these vehicles, or other noteworthy suggestions! We’ll be looking to test drive sometime next year at the earliest.

t2of0n,Stand up for each other,"Stand up for your coworkers: I’ve noticed over the last few years (I moved away for 10 years for work), folks just let each other get walked all over each other now way more than before.  I watched a clearly entitled prick and his buddy berate a very nice server the other day.  She was clearly flustered at the encounter and trying to do what the customer wanted for his drink (he wanted something that wasn’t standard and insisted it was right while berating her), but here’s the thing.  The customer is not always right, and when they’re wrong you do not need to just sit there and pretend like they are while they berate your coworker.  Grow a fucking pair.  There was a time in Bend when these asshats would have been drug out of the bar or store by any locals because you don’t treat people like that.  But Bend is changing.  It’s become a trove for entitled wealthy ass holes wrapped around a tight mesh of Midwestern worker repression.  Now, folks just watch and look down in hurried fear.  Which brings me to my next point.

Owners — stand up for your workers.  If someone is being a jerk — kick them out.  Refuse service if need be.  There’s been a lot of turnover in the last 15 years as to who owns what.  

Lastly, Bend is changing.  Everything is being monetized, and if it ain’t being promoted and monetized then it isn’t welcome.  It sucks that many of the new owners of businesses have pushed that culture of fear.  Just stand up for each other.  The sitting and ignoring just doesn’t cut it, and the culture around the oppressive owner/employee/customer dynamic needs to stop.

I'm not interested in financially supporting people that call me 'the enemy within', 'worse than any foreign enemy' and who want to use the military to persecute the people who simply disagree with them. I'm also not interested in financially supporting those that are destroying my daughters health care, diminishing her status as a person, joking about raping her and treating her like her only value is for pleasing terrible men sexually.

I hope this post isn't breaking any rules, as I am absolutely not advocating for or asking for any type of harassment or doxxing or violence. I just want to know where I can shop and feel good about spending my money. If anyone is maintaining a list, there are a few businesses that I could add myself, and I would be happy to help maintain it.

I'm not going to argue with any Trump supporters, thanks. Boycotts are valid, legitimate and legal, and one of the oldest most effective political tools we have in America. Their effectiveness is why MAGA hate them so much and try to diminish them and minimize them by trying to rebrand boycotts as 'cancel culture' 🙄

An update as of Friday 3:30pm. I'm DMing the people in the thread who have mentioned they've been compiling lists already, after which I'll go through each post and either add it or update the information. I'm very happy to do this collaboratively, if others have suggestions for tools and praxis. 

Thank you, every single one of you, for your contributions. I'm going to shoot for a first-draft finished document by Monday. I'll be looking into the best place to post it so that it can be freely accessed, easily updated, secure, and easy to get. 

It feels good to work towards something positive in the face of all this hopelessness, even if it's small 🇺🇸

1jlkhov,Spring Break in Eugene with two 9-year-old girls.  Update and thank you post.,"Last week I asked you folks what to do in your town with a couple of knife-wielding roller-skating 9-year-old girls.  I had some ideas but you added on to them and I’m very appreciative of all the suggestions.   

Here’s the original post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/Eugene/s/y7JkucZflm  

We didn’t have time to do everything and we found some new stuff along the way.  The following is a list of stuff in no particular order with rankings by the girls and me (where applicable):  

Eugene Science Center:  Despite nearby construction making it confusing to find, the girls enjoyed the exhibits and liked the small-ish size of it compared to OMSI.  8.8/10  

Discovery Riverplay Playground:  Some of the equipment was broken or missing.  “We’re too old for this.”  5.9/10  

Hiron’s:  A new core memory.  11/10  

Yamada Vending:  “This is the best trip of our lives!”  I gave them each $30 in quarters and they were over the moon with their haul.   9.7/10  

Skating around the neighborhood vandalizing Teslas:  I firmly believe that they should focus more on dealerships instead of individual Tesler owners, but I’m not going to be a helicopter parent.  7.7/10  

5th Street Market:  They loved having lemonade by the fountain and going to the unique shops, especially the toy store.  I personally didn’t like it because of all the fancy women, but my phobia of makeup isn’t germane to the girls having a day.  9.1/10  

Putter’s Arcade:  We chose this because it was close to our rental house.  Definitely the saddest arcade we’ve been to.  4.6/10  

Splash! at Lively Park:  It was only $9/kid so I liked that.  And it wasn’t busy for some reason.  My girls are being spoiled with this rating and I think it should be higher.  8.4/10  

Oishii Sushi:  Their first sushi-go-round experience.  They were unsure how to rank it.  8/10  

“The Pipe:”  Perfect.  No notes.  8.9/10  

Claw City:  The owner here was so nice and maybe felt bad for them because they didn’t get much.  The girls loved it and would have spent $200 each if I had let them.  9.4/10  

Cascades Raptor Center:  Probably would have got a higher rating if they weren’t already into birds.  I thought it was cool but there’s only so much I can skew them.  6.8/10  

Claim 52 Brewing:  I went by myself on my night off.  It was fine.  Probably would have had more fun if I wasn’t so goddamm old.  NA/10   

MECCA:  $20 and they have enough craft supplies to last a year?  Fine.  9/10  

Peek-a-boo Delight:  I’ve never met a more genuinely nice person than the owner of that place.  I hope she succeeds.  8.2/10  

The general trail system:  I’m jealous and so were the girls.  Just fucking skate anywhere?  That’s unheard of.  9.1/10

9mv8fw,I like tweakers!,"Being a entrepreneur, I keep my eye and buttocks on the latest Eugene tech. Just the other morning I was going to the office and no, it's not like you think. I had to reset the server to get access to the cloud from my home. Long story that involves Chinese hardware hacks, but suffice it to say that it was a day not spent in loafers with furball resting peacefully on my lap while developing new apps daily for people to blow their minds with. But you want to hear about the buttocks part...I was sitting in my new Model X Tesla! Yep all those rapidly appreciating public tech stocks and whiteaker properties have been GREAT for getting me off my bike and into some zero emission luxury. Was about time that I traded in that old 565i with all the foglight issues. You see I had been stuck on the side of the road with the burned out foglight, pacing back and forth trying to get an Uber or Lyft to pick me up because I am not going to take any chances with highway visibility. Just then this grizzled person on a Cascadian Courier bicycle came up and asked if he could help. Now I had seen him a few hours prior riding with a SECOND BIKE- A big no-no as far as red flags, but he also had a spare wheel that god only knows from whom or where he got it. My TWEAKAR or tweaker radar was going off big time. So here I am just trying to get home safely, and this man rides up and offers his bike headlight to me, and some tape that he had wrapped around an old wrench from his pack. The smell! Anyways, I just smiled and thanked him and then a feeling came over me....maybe this person is the next Elon Musk or John McAffee, who are known successful tweakers- but this guy struggling with grinding poverty that dictates he should thrash around in the gutter trying to subsist on pork rinds and meth, protected from mrsa infections only by his own sweat. So I tossed him a bitcoin, and forwarded a long list of fine Eugene area investment opportunities that I had hacked from the Eugene Chamber Of Commerce. Now every time I see a tweaker riding along, I toss 'em a little care package. It has two bags of cheese puffs a list of Chamber Of commerce green zones for tweaking, and just one pepsi.(don't want to encourage tooth decay!)",Eugene,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eugene/comments/9mv8fw/i_like_tweakers/,10/10/2018 1:43,0,11,oregon

19dzjyt,The most Philly thing ever.,"A tow company kidnapped our car.

My wife was in an accident right near the Princeton Ave on-ramp to 95. She was fine but the car was damaged and not driveable. She called AAA, they dispatched a local tow company to pick up the car. We told both AAA and the tow company itself to tow the car to a specific shop - it’s a Tesla, and only certain shops can do body work on Teslas. The driver confirmed that he’d take the car there. He later confirmed with AAA that the car had been taken there. But when we called the shop to arrange for the insurance adjuster to see the car, they said, “What car?” So we called AAA back and they again confirmed that the tow company had told them the car was delivered to the address we requested. Then we called the tow company itself, and they said, yup, that car is in our lot, and you’ll have to pay $3k in storage fees to get it out. No explanation for why it was towed to their own lot, or why they lied to AAA about delivering it to where we specified. Both AAA and our insurance company are now fighting with them to get the car released.

It was kind of incredible until a tesla driver tried cutting down the middle and of course several people blocked them…. But i tell you up until that point it felt like we all decided no we are not more important than what ever horrible thing is happening ahead of us.

t7kb1a,Electric cars and driving through flood spots,"Probably a dumb question, but when we get a bit of flooding, with a gas powered car its often okay to drive through the shallower puddles.

With an electric car like a Tesla, I’m wondering how safe it actually is to do the same?

It’s probably fine, but something about having a giant high voltage battery and driving through a brackish water puddle full of salt and other conductive ions seems like it might be dangerous.

Do any Charleston Tesla/electric owners know if this is reasonably safe?",Charleston,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charleston/comments/t7kb1a/electric_cars_and_driving_through_flood_spots/,3/5/2022 22:19,13,6,southcarolina

I recently moved to South Dakota and I have an unheated detached garage. With the temperatures dropping, I'm curious about the impact on charging times and the battery when using a standard household outlet.

Specifically, I'm interested in how long it takes for the battery to heat up before adding miles to the range when charging at 110V in extreme cold conditions. I'm aware that the cold weather can affect battery performance, but I'd love to hear about your first-hand experiences.

Questions:

1. How has your Tesla performed in winter conditions in South Dakota or similar climates when using a 110V outlet?
2. Have you noticed any significant delays in charging times due to the cold weather?
3. Do you take any extra steps to mitigate the impact of cold temperatures on the battery when charging at 110V?

19ajxef,Farmer’s Wave in Sioux Falls,"My kids this morning wondered “dad, why do you do that thing with your fingers?” 

So I explained the farmers wave. 

They asked “so it’s just trucks?” 

To which I said no, not necessarily, that’s just what we drove by when you saw me do it just now. 

“Do you do it for all cars?” 

Well, also no….

“Why not those cars?” (gestures to ones across median)

Well, I usually don’t when there’s a median. 

“Why not this line of cars?” 

Well, because I would have to have machine guns for fingers. (Freedom intensifies /s)



I think this made me realize that Sioux Falls is such a mix of country and city that I do the Farmer’s wave here, but can’t do it for everyone. I thought about it more and I think the best way to describe to my kids *when* I do it is when I’m driving on a slower road with a vehicle coming toward me where I make eye contact with the driver and we share a non-NPC moment of genuine midwestern/connection.

I drive for work, am from a different country where I've driven, and have driven across the continent, yet Nashville takes the cake for the absolute worst drivers I've ever encountered. Running solid reds, whipping through traffic, whipping and speeding through active school zones, passing on shoulders, passing in turning lanes, driving in opposing lanes to skip traffic, tailgating so close I can reach out and touch their bumper (once had a guy so close I could only see his mirrors through my mirrors), going through stop signs full speed (Harding Place/Donelson intersection is horrible for this), and twice in the last two weeks I've seen a car stop for a red that the guy behind them wanted to run, causing them to rear end the first guy. Do people really think that they're that important compared to everyone else? To the point where they'll put everyone else's lives at risk? Is it really that critical to get one car length ahead at the next light to drive like that? I've seen people do stuff like this right in front of cops and they've done nothing. It's a joke.

Hello everyone,

Yesterday someone hit my 23 day old Model 3 while it was parked in my apartment garage. It needs to have bodywork done (rear door, quarter panel, rear bumper, and rim) but the Tesla dealer in Brentwood doesn't have a repair shop yet. My 2 options are Beaman in downtown or European Collision Repair in Antioch. ECR looks to have more and better reviews but I wanted to see if anyone has used either and can share their experience getting their Tesla repaired.

1hsy1m7,"The Inglewood Evening Dispatch, Vol. 25","Dearest Cecilia,



I made you come outside in the summer heat to admire it. You blew out through your nose in a gentle *fnff* and grinned. You took hold of my grimy left hand and said, 



“I think it’s cute that you take pride in yard work.”



It was unusually warm for December. Mary and I were enjoying the opportunity to read together on the front porch. She was annotating a copy of *All Fours* by Miranda July with a fervor that I dared not disturb. I refuse to tell you what I was reading. I *would* be reading *that*. 



A familiar white Isuzu truck slid around the corner and puttered to a stop in front of Wanda Clifton’s house. This truck is a local icon, one that I can remember seeing since I was just a boy, one that pulls a variety of big cool toys on a big cool metal trailer. Eddie Peoples had arrived to service one of what he calls *The Peoples Lawns*. 



Eddie is tall and handsome. He has gotten away with many things in his 58 years. I don’t understand how his ever-present white Titans hat hasn’t fallen apart. Maybe he bought a big bag of them when Steve McNair died. Maybe Steve himself gave Eddie the hat and it is imbued with some sort of invulnerable magic. That’s probably what Eddie would tell you.



“You gonna let me cut that lawn?” he hollered at me from the curb. 



“I let it go after Halloween, Eddie.” I said. He clapped the door of the truck shut and walked over to meet me. I shook his hand. I’ve known Eddie a long, long time, Cecilia. 



“Your ol man was good at masonry work. But he didn’t never have no sense of that lawn.” Eddie said. 



I would have to agree with Eddie on that one. 



“I like to think I have the sense to cut it downhill and diagonal.” I said. Eddie narrowed his eyes and bit his lip. Eddie knew what he was going to say before I’d ever responded. 



“Your lawn was the last lawn I was cuttin before I heard about Nine Eleven.” he said. Cecilia, I remember the first time you heard Eddie tell this story. I sent you outside to hear it for yourself, as I’d heard it nine or eleven times before. I withstood it once again. 



“You been good?” I eventually responded.



“Yeah, yeah I have. I haven’t heard nothin out of Wanda though. She paid me in August but since then, nothin.” he said. 



“I’ve seen her since then. But…” I trailed off. I actually hadn’t seen Wanda in some time. I hadn’t really been paying attention to Wanda’s house. I am always distracted by the passing ravens and ruby sunsets of my Leopold Street, and my lounging Mary, who is now glaring up at me over reading glasses, her eyes like polished jasper. I am positively full of shit. 



“Wanda’s car’s here.” Eddie said. “It was gone all November.”



“Well, have you knocked on her door?” I asked. Eddie raised his eyebrows. 



“I knock on a lot of doors, Heck. You used to, huh? In the scouts?” he said as a smile grew across his face. Somehow Eddie had folded time to make it 2001 once again. Trustworthy, loyal, courteous and kind, I silently agreed to undergo a trip to Wanda’s doorstep.   



“Some lawn guys take Venmo.” I said as I rapped on the door. Wanda did not immediately answer. I counted to ten in my head and knocked with a different cadence. 



“She’s here. Mm. Look.” Eddie said. We walked over and peered inside her purple Mitsubishi Mirage. There were cigarette butts in the cup holder. 



“Ugh,” I said, “should I knock again?” 



“Come on over here.” Eddie told me. We walked around to the back. Wanda’s empty chicken coop was falling apart. The dead grass in the gate’s threshold yielded into the slick dogshit clay of repeated footsteps. The first days of winter provide us with naked and honest glimpses of our homes. For some reason Eddie decided to stop and say this to me: 



“I saw your old lady workin upt the WalMart a couple weeks back. She was in sportin goods.” Eddie said. We all want to feel younger until we’re reduced to who we once were. 



“They’ll have to scrape her out of a WalMart uniform whenever she kicks the bucket.” I said. Are we the person that resides in the imperfect snapshot of others’ memory? I worry about that with you, Cecilia. Eddie cupped his hands to the rear window and looked into Wanda’s room. 



“Look, Heck. Aw, Hell.” He said.



Wanda was splayed out on her bed with her arms up against the headboard. She was absolutely still. She was in a purple camisole with a slipper clinging tenuously to her right foot. The muffled sound of the TV mirrored the shifting glow against the wall. 



“Heck, she’s dead. She’s been dead. Look at how she’s layin. I can smell her from here.” Eddie whispered. I peered inside and fogged the glass with a gentle *fnff*. I rolled my eyes and knocked on the window. I have known Wanda for a long, long time, Cecilia.



“Now wait…” Eddie said and swatted my hand away like a scared tenderfoot. The shape of Wanda sat up bolt upright and hollered something unintelligible. Eddie ducked and winced.



“You wrong for that one, Heck.” Eddie said as he took off for the gate. 



“I thought…” I trailed off and shrugged my shoulders. I pushed the gate open with a single finger as I followed Eddie to the driveway. *“I thought”* may be all there’s room for on my tombstone. 



Wanda popped open her storm door as she tightened her robe around her waist. 



“The two of you!” she said in the manner of a second grade teacher. 



“Eddie was asking about you,” I began, “he said it’s been a while since-” 



“That orta be your last name, Eddie Beenawhile.” Wanda pointed at him. 



“Saw you might need a cut, how are you, Miss Wanda?” Eddie cheesed. 



“What you fixin to cut? The onion grass?” Wanda glared at him. 



“Wanda, it’s a tune up.It’s on me.” He replied



“I orta give you a *tune up*. Okay then. I ain’t upset. Eddie, Honey, it’s time you heard, I’m fixin to move up to Clarksville.” She said.  



“Movin out, huh?” he managed.  



“Mhmm. I’m listin this place shortly.” Wanda clutched her robe to her chest. 



“I’m sorry to hear that.” Eddie said. I too was surprised. I looked at my muddy shoes. 



“My sister Lisa’s got lupus and she’s up there and well, I don’t even know why I held out this long.” she said. The gentle roar of an overhead jet filled our silence.  



“You gettin a good rate for the place?” he asked. Wanda looked up at the gathering clouds. 



“I don’t know yet.” she said. 



“That’s a solid brick house.” Eddie said. I can’t really describe the way that Eddie said that. There was sadness in it. Eddie was always a bullshitter. But not there. He’s seen plenty of solid brick houses. There are fewer of them around now. I can’t be sure but I believe that the little strands of winter grass in our lawns keep drifting side to side in the breeze whether we watch them or not. 



“Let me cut you a check for the past few months and be done with it.” Wanda said. Eddie nodded. She walked back inside to get her checkbook. I gave Eddie a reverent nod and stepped away.  



From a distance I saw Eddie and Wanda finish their transaction. Eddie tucked the check into his pocket and waited for a Tesla to pass by before he walked back across the street to his truck. Why do I care so much, Cecilia? I don’t have to let these things tear away at me. Yet they do. 



“Eddie!” I yelled. He turned and looked at me. 



“Get your mower out and show me how you cut this god damned lawn.” I said. 



“Yes sir, yes sir. You know, Heck, I’ll never forget!” he yelled. 



Yours, 



Hector Fogg

pqcca5,Are car dealers as dumb as they appear?,"My wife and I have been to 4 dealers over the last few weeks. At Tesla and Audi, they said their COVID protocol was to not join customers for test rides - we were on our own. Great! At Volvo and VW the genius car salesman were more than happy to jump in the car with us without even offering to wear a mask. 

Like, dafuq? I don’t know you. I don’t know if you’re vaccinated. And you’re too dumb to even ask if we’re comfortable sharing a car maskless with a total stranger. And these are brands that tend to cater to a fairly educated and liberal crowd that clearly biases towards mask wearing. 

So my question is - are all dealers this stupid that they don’t even understand, or care about, their own customers?

1j3g5mt,Effective Activism Strategy Statement,"I’ve seen a lot of posts and calls to action in this group, and I think Knoxvillians can better focus their energy. In an effort to avoid being downvoted into oblivion, I’ve made this as politically neutral as possible so it applies to whatever issues you care about here in Knoxville. Please comment with effective Knoxville based examples, especially organizations that are making a real impact in their mission. I’ve organized this into sections so you can focus on what interests you and skip the rest. I’m genuinely concerned about the time and energy people are spending calling elected officials’ offices and protesting outside buildings. This isn’t meant as an insult, mockery, or criticism. I’m not here to kick you when you’re feeling down. My advice is simply to save your energy and focus your efforts where they can actually be effective. Activism is a long game and burning yourself out by reacting to everything only weakens your impact. If you want real change, it’s worth thinking about where your actions will make the biggest difference.

 

TLDR VERSION: Activism is a long game, and your energy is limited, so focus on where you can be most effective. Avoid performative actions that feel like activism but rarely lead to real change. Flooding elected officials' offices with calls or attending every protest for every issue spreads you too thin. Voting regularly matters more than complaining. Pick one or two major issues and work toward real solutions instead of just stopping things without a plan for what comes next. Build relationships even with people you disagree with because influence comes from respect, not outrage. Know when you have a temporary loss and pivot your efforts instead of fighting a battle that is already over. Boycotts usually fail unless nearly everyone participates and the company needs you more than you need them. Sustainable change comes from persistence, strategy, and knowing when and where your actions will have the most impact.

 

FULL VERSION BELOW

 

PERFORMATIVE ACTIONS

Performative activism is often about signaling solidarity rather than creating real change. There is a place for this, it draws attention to an issue and helps people identify like-minded allies. But most of these actions fall into the category of slacktivism. Liking, sharing, posting, retweeting, adding flag emojis, using profile picture banners, forwarding emails, joining online groups, or calling elected officials’ offices just to tie up the phone lines might feel like activism, but they rarely accomplish much on their own. There are moments when demonstrations in mass are truly effective, like the March on Washington, which was undeniably a turning point. However, smaller protests, scattered demonstrations, or even coordinated efforts across multiple locations rarely lead to significant change on their own. It would be helpful to think about how these actions are perceived by others. Those in opposition or even on the fence often see these efforts as performative virtue signaling, especially if someone constantly engages in them for multiple causes without a clear focus. If you are spreading yourself too thin across various issues, it can make your activism seem reactionary rather than purposeful. Activists attending protests would likely be more effective if they focused on collecting participant information to channel that energy into real future efforts rather than assuming the gathering itself is enough to make an impact. See later sections on choosing a single issue and persistence.

 

Example: If you are protesting in Market Square or outside the City-County Building, make sure your presence translates into action by organizing petitions, attending public meetings, or scheduling discussions with local officials.

 

 

CALLING ELECTED OFFICIALS OFFICES

Think of it like calling 911 because you’re unhappy with crime rates. The dispatcher can take your complaint, but they aren’t the ones setting policy, and tying up their time doesn’t make the streets any safer. Similarly, the staff in an elected official’s office are often more like caseworkers, helping constituents navigate government services, solve bureaucratic issues, or connect with resources. Flooding their phones in anger over a policy stance isn’t meaningful activism, it only makes it harder for them to assist people who actually need help. There are moments when overwhelming pressure can be effective, such as in the lead-up to a major vote or a time-sensitive decision, but constant, unfocused call-ins do more harm than good. If you want to change policy, direct your energy toward voting, organizing, and applying pressure in ways that matter, such as scheduling one-on-one meetings where possible for specific issues, engaging in advocacy, or influencing elections. Calling to yell at a congressional aide is like demanding a restaurant server change the entire menu. It is misplaced effort that won’t get the results you want. That office could be trying to help a child’s parents navigate a complex system to get an organ transplant or assisting a family in repatriating a loved one’s body after they died overseas. By flooding the phone lines, you may be disrupting people who desperately need help. If a crucial vote is coming up and the decision maker is on the fence, they may ask their staff what people are saying, but that kind of influence is most effective when it comes from organized, strategic engagement rather than an endless stream of angry calls.

 

VOTE

People don’t realize just how important voting is. It’s not just your right, it’s your primary source of power. Register, show up, and vote in every election, even if you don’t vote for everything on the ballot. Local, county, state, and federal elections, especially in non-presidential years, matter just as much as the big ones. Your voting record is public information, not who you voted for, but whether you vote and in which primaries you participate. Campaigns, candidates, and decision-makers pay attention to this. If you don’t vote regularly, your opinion carries less weight. A call or complaint from someone who isn’t registered or rarely votes means nothing. But if you vote consistently, you become part of the electorate that gets polled, contacted, and considered when policies are shaped. Want to be heard? Speak loudly with your vote. Stop complaining and start showing up. Who gets heard???  It’s possible that elected officials give more weight to the people who voted for them than those who voted against them. If you were an official who won with 60 percent of the vote and someone tells you they didn’t vote for you, you now know they’re likely part of the 40 percent who will never support you. That doesn’t mean representatives don’t listen, but it may change how much effort they put into winning over certain groups. I once asked a seasoned politician what they thought about the youth vote. Their response surprised me: “What youth vote? They don’t vote. Senior citizens vote in every election, but you never know if the youth will even show up.” That answer tells you everything about how politicians prioritize voters. If you want your concerns taken seriously, you have to show up, not just once, but consistently. See sections picking a major issue, building relationships, and being persistent.

CHOOSE A MAJOR ISSUE (maybe only 1-2 main things)

Marcus Aurelius said you don’t have to have an opinion on everything. Well, actually, he said, “You always own the option of having no opinion. There is never any need to get worked up or to trouble your soul about things you can't control. These things are not asking to be judged by you. Leave them alone.” That might be a little too stoic or even nihilistic for my taste, but the core idea holds true. You can choose to focus your attention on what you can actually be effective on. Most people don’t have the time, energy, or resources to be involved with every worthwhile cause, and there are a lot of worthy causes out there. But you have to choose. Maybe it is a healthcare issue, education, civil rights, voting rights, economic policy, or taxes. Whatever it is, focus your energy on getting involved with a formal group that has worked on a specific solution or policy. Work toward getting one-on-one meetings with decision-makers to advocate for something concrete. Consider the appropriate level of government intervention. Maybe it is something completely local like a school board issue. Maybe it is a national or larger issue like refugees. Maybe it is a county zoning issue or something statewide like THC and CBD legalization. Whatever it is, focus on creating actual movement on that issue. Be part of a solution. It will be harder but far more rewarding. See my sections on persistence and performative activism.

 

Are you concerned about housing? Get involved with organizations working on affordable housing in Knoxville, like Knoxville’s Community Development Corporation (KCDC) or the Knoxville Area Urban League. If schools are your priority, attend Knox County School Board meetings where real policy is made. If you care about environmental issues, work with Keep Knoxville Beautiful, the local Sierra Club, or active, engaged organizations like the Appalachian Mountain Bike Club (AMBC), which helps protect and develop outdoor spaces. Maybe posters can share other local organizations to engage with for specific issues.

 

 

RELATIONSHIPS 

“You can disagree without being disagreeable” is a quote often attributed to Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Effective community activists keep lines of communication open with their political opposition and adversaries. You can fight like hell to achieve something or push to change a policy you oppose, but if your only stance is that your representatives are evil or stupid (which may be true), you will struggle to build the relationships needed to create real change. If you are honest, frank, and respectful, you may find that even political opponents seek your opinion on important matters, even if you don’t agree. But they won’t invite you into their decision-making process if you have no cordial relationship with them or their staff. Calling to disrupt staff or insulting them may feel good in the moment, but it does nothing to further your cause. It never hurts to be pleasant, even when discussing something difficult. Staff members have influence, and how you treat them will likely affect how your opinions are relayed to the decision-makers you want to reach.

 

Knoxville Example: There are ways to engage with your officials. Knoxville City Council, Knox County Commission, Knox County School Board, and other boards have open meetings where you can sign up to speak. But showing up to react to a single issue is not the same as having ongoing influence. A member of the AMBC bike club advocating for greenway expansions is more likely to have an audience with the mayor than a group of people reacting to a controversial decision. If your goal is access, you need to understand what keeps the gate closed and what will open it. Someone who is formally involved with a single issue over time is far more likely to get a one-on-one meeting with a Knoxville official. Knoxville’s federal representatives also hold regular meetings with community groups. Ask yourself how to get into the community that has an audience with decision-makers. It happens by building relationships, not just making noise.

 

 

CHANGING PEOPLES OPINION

In activism, accomplishing any real change in the face of opposition is rare. The goal is not always to completely change someone’s mind but to shift public opinion in favor of your issue. This is the holy grail of activism. People don’t change their views because they are shouted at in public, labeled, or insulted. Most people need a meaningful external experience or connection to reconsider their stance. Change happens when people arrive at new perspectives on their own terms, often through respectful dialogue or personal experiences. Negative interactions with opponents can backfire, turning a simple opinion into a core identity that they feel the need to defend. If someone feels attacked, they are more likely to dig in deeper rather than reconsider. In that sense, attacking people for their opinions can actually hurt your cause rather than help it. See my sections on relationships and choosing a major issue.

 

Knoxville Example: Several people in Knoxville have recently lost their jobs or are facing funding cuts to federal, state, or local programs that impact their daily lives. This includes programs in Tennessee and Knox County that people rely on IE: public school funding and vouchers, public housing, homelessness and warming centers, KPD or Knox Sheriff policies. When someone says, “I feel like my vote backfired” or “I didn’t vote for this,” they are likely already questioning their previous stance. In that moment, they may be open to an alternative viewpoint—but not from you if you were calling them names or attacking them personally. Buyers’ remorse is often far more effective at opening someone up to another perspective than direct confrontation ever will be.

 

PERSISTENCE:

“The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.” This phrase, often attributed to Stephen Covey, author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, is an important mantra when deciding how many causes to focus on. If you spread yourself too thin across too many issues, you will struggle to make meaningful progress on any of them. This is why some activists seem to be at every protest for every cause. They don’t have the time or focus to engage deeply enough to create real change. Instead, they spend small bits of time showing up at random demonstrations, adding banners to their social media, or making symbolic gestures without a clear path to impact. True persistence means sticking with a cause long enough to see results, not just participating in the activism cycle without a plan.

 

Knoxville Example: What are some issues and organizations in Knoxville that are focusing on constructive solutions? If you care about local environmental efforts, groups like Keep Knoxville Beautiful and the Appalachian Mountain Bike Club have made tangible impacts. If education is your priority, Knox County Schools and local PTAs are constantly engaged in policy discussions. If you want to see change, the key is consistency, involvement, and long-term commitment. Comment or share Knoxville organizations that are keeping their main thing the main thing.

 

KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE A TEMPORARY LOSS ON AN ISSUE:

Effective activism isn’t about winning every battle—it’s about knowing which fights are still winnable. If a decision is final or momentum has shifted irreversibly, continuing to fight the same fight is a waste of time and energy. That doesn’t mean giving up entirely, but it does mean adapting. Redirect efforts toward influencing future outcomes, shaping the next opportunity, or building leverage for a long-term shift. The most effective activists know when to pivot, regroup, and refocus their energy where it can make the biggest impact. Look up your civil rights activism in the early 20th century. There were efforts for a long time and they had a lot of setbacks. A devastating supreme court opinion Plessy v. Ferguson was decided in 1896, establishing the ""separate but equal"" doctrine that upheld racial segregation. It was not until Brown v. Board of Education was decided in 1954, overturning Plessy and ruling that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. There was a lot of work in between. Eventually it resulted in the Civil Rights Act in 1964, Voting in 1965, and Fair Housing in 1968. See my sections on persistence.  

 

STOPPING vs STARTING SOMETHING

It is far easier to be part of a movement that stops something than one that starts something new. Many things do need to be stopped, and if you succeed in halting something you oppose, that might seem like a victory. But before you push to shut something down, ask yourself what else you are stopping in the process. Stopping something without a plan for what comes next can create a vacuum, and sometimes what fills that space is far worse than what was removed. True progress often requires not just opposition but the effort to build something better in its place. That takes more time, energy, and persistence, but it is also how lasting change happens. Effective activism is not just about saying no, it is about having a vision for what should come next. See my sections on persistence, relationships, and knowing when you have a temporary loss for why this matters.

 

Examples:

The push to fund Knoxville’s Greenway expansion took years of advocacy and planning, not just protests Efforts to stop the baseball stadium faced strong opposition, but without a coordinated plan for an alternative, the development moved forward anyway.

 

 

LASTLY… BOYCOTTS

Boycotts only work when nearly everyone participates and the company needs consumers more than consumers need the company. Most fail because corporations are too big, convenience wins, attention spans are short, and backlash can turn into a “buycott.” Without full participation or viable alternatives, the impact is usually symbolic rather than strategic.

 

Knoxville Example: Everybody and there mother in this sub hates the owner of Calhoun’s. It isn’t hurting their business.

 

Notable Ineffective Boycotts

\-Freedom Fries (2003), U.S. politicians renamed French fries in protest of France’s opposition to the Iraq War. The change was quietly reversed.

\-Starbucks (2017, 2019, 2020+), Boycotted by conservatives over holiday cups and by progressives over unionization. The company remains highly profitable.

\-Nike (2018, 2019), Boycotted by conservatives over Colin Kaepernick’s ad campaign and later over a pulled Betsy Ross flag shoe. Sales surged instead.

\-Keystone XL Pipeline (2021), Conservatives boycotted businesses linked to Biden’s pipeline cancellation, but large corporations were unaffected.

\-Chick-fil-A (Multiple Years), Boycotted by liberals over LGBTQ+ issues and by conservatives when the company shifted donation policies. Sales continued to grow.

\-Goya Foods (2020), A boycott over the CEO’s praise of Trump led to a conservative “buycott,” causing a sales surge.

\-Ben & Jerry’s (Multiple Years), Boycotted by conservatives over progressive stances and by progressives over their Israel policies. The brand remains strong.

\-Disney (Multiple Years), Boycotted over LGBTQ+ representation, political donations, and COVID-19 policies. Disney continues to dominate entertainment.

\-Bud Light (2023), A boycott over a partnership with trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney caused an initial sales drop, but the brand remains a top seller.

\-Spotify (2022), A boycott over Joe Rogan’s COVID-19 misinformation controversy had little effect on the company’s financials.

\-Hobby Lobby (2014, 2020), Boycotted by liberals over contraception policies and LGBTQ+ stances, but the company remains profitable.

\-Tesla (2022, 2023), Boycotted by liberals over Elon Musk’s political views, but EV adoption kept sales rising.

\-NFL (2017, 2020), Boycotted by conservatives over Kaepernick kneeling and later by progressives over race issues. The NFL remains the most-watched sport in the U.S.

\-Uber (2017), The #DeleteUber campaign briefly hurt the company after it undermined a taxi strike, but Uber recovered quickly.

\-Walmart (Multiple Years), Boycotted by conservatives over gun policies and by liberals over labor practices. It remains the largest retailer in the world.

For those of you who haven't seen it, Dick's built a new ""House of Sports"" connected to West Town Mall. It's one of 2 in the country, the other being in New York. It's got an outdoor play area/track for kids. An indoor 2-story rock climbing wall. A *massive* selection of cleats....

Honestly, I can't even tell you what else they've got, because I spent 2 hours in the cleats section, lol. It was the first time I've had the chance to try out really nice cleats in person. I'd never been able to justify spending well over $100 on a pair online that I couldn't try on first & it's awesome we finally have a place to do it!

If you're even remotely interested in sports equipment, I highly recommend checking it out. I didn't venture past the soccer section, but I recommended it to some friends who are into golf & fishing & they both loved it & wound up getting some stuff.  A group of us are planning on going back as soon as our schedules line up this week.

I'm never the type to fill out emailed surveys, but I was sure to let their corporate know just how awesome the entire experience was.

3kl7si,Attended Governor Haslam's talk about funding the transportation system yesterday - he asked for feedback,"Yesterday I had the opportunity to attend Governor Haslam's talk about funding the state's transportation system. It seems like a pretty big deal and he asked for feedback at the end. I thought I'd give /r/knoxville the rundown of the issue and the email address as well.

With falling revenues from the gasoline tax thanks to more fuel efficient cars, it is becoming very difficult for the DoT to even keep up with maintenance on current roads. This is to say nothing of new projects. Essentially, road use is trending up while income is trending down.

The Governor and his staff seem set on resolving the issue rather than letting the roads fall into disrepair. My guess is they will do this by raising revenues (ie: taxes). While they didn't say it outright, I think the easiest course of action for them will be to raise the gas tax.

Here is my own opinion on the matter: raising the gas tax is a poor idea. It does nothing to solve the long-term issue of increasingly fuel efficient cars meaning less revenue and it unfairly hits low-income families with a greater tax burden. I have no data at the moment, but my intuitive guess is that the people driving newer, more fuel efficient cars have a greater income while those driving older, less fuel efficient cars have less.

Remember this is not strictly an issue of sub-compact vs SUV, it is an issue of older vs newer.

Taxing gas only shifts more of the burden to those low-income individuals and families who drive older cars. I do not dispute the need for more revenue, but I do not think raising the gas tax is the way do to it. Why should a CEO who drives a Tesla get to use our road system for free while the working single mom driving around in her 20 year old Ford Taurus pay more than her share?

I don't know the proper answer to this. Find something else to tax that more closely tracks to actual miles driven? I know what I suggested, but I won't post it here unless someone wants to know. All I know is simply raising the gas tax is a very bad way of solving this.

The email address Governor Haslam shared is this:

transportation.needs@tn.gov

10hspts,"My wife and I Relocated from the Chicago Area to Austin for my job opportunity. Wanted to give a review on your great city, and why we are considering settling down in the Houston Area."," 

Hello everyone, my wife and I moved to Austin in November for my job opportunity with Tesla. I wanted to give a honest review on Austin, and why were planning to move to Houston at the end of the year. Here’s a brief background on us:

Me and my wife are 31 years old. We’re both black and grew up in the South Suburbs of Chicago and lived most of our lives. I am electrician and have been in the field for 5 years, my wife just graduated with her bachelor’s degree in political science/Public Law and is trying to get her career started in the paralegal/legal assistant field.  We are both simple and suburban. We are foodies and we like doing fun activities, but to really into night light stuff.  In October, I was offered a job with Tesla as a Technician, and we relocated. My wife landed a job soon after we got here as a legal secretary. I love Texas so far as a whole, but we concluded that Austin isn’t a good fit for us as a long-term location, and I’ll explain why. Disclaimer: This is just my opinion and I’m still trying figure out Austin, so some thing may change as time goes on.

First off, the pros of Austin. Austin is a very scenic city. Texas hill country is beautiful and has some great views.  Austin has a dope nightlife if your into that type of thing. Austin also has a great job market if you’re in tech or law. However, that where it ends for us. After that Austin become an overcrowded college/tech city that lacks culture. The vibe just doesn’t feel right here. I thought when they said “keep Austin Weird” it was a joke, but boy they weren’t lying lol.   The food is not bad here, but it lacks variety. I’ve had some of the best Mexican food and barbecue down here, but after that there isn’t much more to it. Being from Chicago area, we had a vast variety of different food because of the diverse cultures it has. Which leads me to my next issue, diversity in Austin. There’s not much diversity and culture here, especially for the things I do as hobbies. Besides cars and cooking, one of my hobbies is roller skating. Chicago’s skating scene is a vibe. This was one of the things I was getting deeper into right before I made the move.  From talking to people from here that are pros at skating, they tell me that Austin is still trying to figure out it’s style. Where as Houston and Dallas have their skating culture and style set in stone like Chicago does. The final reason why I’m not settling here is the housing cost, it’s depressingly expensive. I refuse to buy our first house here. I know places like Pflugerville, Round Rock, and even San Marcos are all other good options to look into, but I still feel like its not a good fit for us. Now onto Houston.

We came to Houston for the first time in May of 2021 for my wife’s friend birthday. I didn’t have the best time, and it was mainly because her itinerary was a bunch of clubs, lounges, and expensive restaurants. Also, because it was Memorial Day weekend it was unbearable to be outside if you’re not prepared for Houston Humidity lol. We went to a place called Kamp, I remember it was so hot and humid I got irritated, abruptly left the table, and went and sat in the car in the AC until they were all finished.  One thing I did like about Houston was the amazing seafood, the hospitality of the people, and the vibe was great. After the trip I said I would probably not come back to Houston, but After reading a lot about Houston on reddit and moving to Texas, I talked to my wife and said maybe I shouldn’t let that bad experience deter me.

So on to 2022 New year’s Eve weekend, we decided to do a to Houston our way. My friend has always told me about Katy, so I decided to book a hotel in that area. I don’t know if anyone in here is from the Chicago area but coming into the Houston metro (Katy) eastbound on I-10 is very similar to coming into the Chicago Metro (Aurora) eastbound on I-88. You see all the commercial and industrial complexes, then you see all the stores and outlet malls. Soon as I got into Katy and to our hotel, I felt home. I am an avid car enthusiast and love all cars (I have a C6 Corvette), and What I really loved was being off I-10 and hearing all the cars hauling 5.0 Mustangs, Corvette and Camaro, a few turbo V8 Silverados lol. I went out by myself the night we got in and drove around and went to a near skating rink to see how the sessions were, and it definitely was a vibe. Houston skating scene is similar yet different than Chicago. I’d say the difference between them is Chicago’s is smoother than Houston. By the time I left the rink it was around 1230am, I drove back to the hotel. I stayed out a little later clowning around with other car enthusiasts that were out, so I got back to the hotel around 130. I haven’t had a fun night like this in a while.

The next day, my wife and I got up early and toured around the city looking at neighborhoods we could see ourselves moving. We checked out Cypress and Katy and saw some nice areas that were affordable, but we are going to come back next month to check other areas out. We then went to Crawfish Café (amazing btw), and then toured the Heights by that time headed back towards the hotel. New Year’s Day, we headed back to Austin planning to come back every month to get a better feel for Houston.

Anyway sorry to ramble on, but I say all this to say we are currently setting a plan to move to the Houston area by the end of the year. I’m planning to finish this year with Tesla, and to possibly join IBEW 716 electrician union with my experience as an electrician, and eventually become a contractor. My wife wants to get her career established as a paralegal in Houston and eventually to UH for law school. Our next trip, we are going to check out the Spring, Humble area.


UPDATE (copied from a comment) :

I appreciate everyone for the advice and gratitude. I did not expect this post to get this much attention and love 😂.   The cons I got from some comments was the humidity and traffic.   I guess the trade off is in some ways I prefer humidity over the bone chilling colds and snow we get in Chicago every years.  I do know that global warming is real, but me and my wife will adapt.  Plus my skin is thankful for humidity vs dry 😆

As far as traffic goes, for 3 years I used to commute daily from the far South Suburbs to Southwest side of Chicago (80 miles round trip) and if I didn't time it right I would sit in traffic for 60-90 mins one way mins daily.   However before we make any moving decisions, we will see where we will be working to make our commute less painful.

However, the trade off is the food, culture, vibe, and the people in HOU.  Also the opportunities of jobs and entrepreneurs.",houston,https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/10hspts/my_wife_and_i_relocated_from_the_chicago_area_to/,1/21/2023 14:41,487,395,texas

16h9fye,I’m in the market for a new car. Can someone recommend an actual somewhat honest car dealership? Or does it not exist in Houston?,"Update: hey everyone, thanks for the great discussion thread. My insurance company used to offer a super helpful new-car-buying service that locked a dealer into a price/vehicle before you even walked in the door, but they’ve discontinued that program. I’m all about doing thorough research before ever reaching out to a dealership but wanted to narrow down my list of dealerships to even consider.

The new car brokerage seems like an interesting idea. I didn’t even know that was a thing.

vimoen,Beware of shady sales tactics at Lone Star Chevrolet,"Be wary of any deal or agreement you don't have specifically in writing with this dealership. I ordered a new Corvette from this dealership in 2019 and picked it up in 2020. When I was placing the order, we agreed that I would be able to order one of the new 2023 Z06 when they were available and would trade my 2020 Corvette in at that time. A year later, when I picked my car up, this was still the agreement and understanding. I spoke with the sales people, including the sales manager, several times after picking up my car about this, and ensured that I did indeed have my place reserved to order the new Z06. In 2022, when it was almost time for the pre-orders of the 2023 Z06 to start, they changed their tune and told me that they would not be accepting any pre-orders for Z06. In a separate conversation I had with the sales manager, he said that it was his understanding that the General Manager, Johnnie Smith, had decided that they would be purchasing any allotment of Z06 they got as showroom cars so they can turn around and sell them for significant markup/profit over MSRP. This dealership clearly values its profits far more than satisfied customers. I would look elsewhere if you're looking for a dealership that has your best interest and satisfaction in mind. Since I already had an agreement with them to pre-order my Z06, I didn't try to secure similar agreements with any other dealerships and now I've missed the opportunity to order this unique car, probably forever.",houston,https://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/vimoen/beware_of_shady_sales_tactics_at_lone_star/,6/23/2022 2:57,363,169,texas

Went in for an oil change (it was cheaper than anywhere else and I got them free for buying the car there) 

They did their 21 point inspection and came back and told me my brakes needed to be replaced ASAP. Told them we had just replaced them ourselves 6 weeks prior. Dumbass goes away and comes back and tells me that he’s mistaken because they aren’t OEM brakes they aren’t as thick as Honda brakes and that’s why he said that. 

I knew better. So I quit going there. 

Switched to Big star on 45 because again they were cheaper on oil changes. 

Check engine light came on so dummy me thought it would make sense to just have them tell me what was wrong while it’s there for an oil change he 

They came back and told me the piston rings on my 2015 pilot need to be replaced at a cost of 4k. And that he can’t legally recommend a junkyard engine (I didn’t even ask about that) 

So I pick it up and drive it to my trusted mechanic who also felt the piston ring line was bullshit and he replaced the spark plugs and the car is just fine.

1hceu2d,"Rant: Houston Is A Great, But Overrated City With Some Major Flaws","Even though Houston and Dallas are nowhere close to being ranked as the worst city in America (in fact, they are actually great cities and the nominees for the ""worst"" cities in America are cities like Gary IN, Detroit MI, McAllen TX, Monroe LA, and St Louis MO), they are nonetheless one of the most overrated cities in America, along with the likes of Austin, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Jacksonville, Albuquerque, and Salt Lake City. Houston, along with these other cities have seen rapid growth since 2000.

Due to the fact I (23M) have recently visited both cities in the past week and drove to Texas on a 2-day-long drive from Boston, I am semi-qualified to corroborate my arguments on why Houston and Dallas are considered ""overrated"".

Preamble:

Houston and Dallas are by no means ""bad"" cities. In fact, they contain many affluent suburbs such as Sugar Land, the Woodlands, Bellaire, West University Place, Southside Place, Frisco, Plano, Coppell, Southlake, and University/Highland Park, and Houston and Dallas are quite ok cities, with a lot of amenities, ethnic diversity, and lucrative job opportunities, specifically in the medical/healthcare, tech/software, biotech, finance, and oil/petroleum sectors. What I mean as ""overrated"" is these two cities are way too overhyped in perception compared to the actualities of the two as Houston and Dallas has seen explosive population growth since the 1990s and even during the 2020s due to remote work from home policies. In fact, Frisco, the fastest growing city in America, has grown from a meagre 6k people in 1990 (as small as Dover MA) to 200k according to the 2020 US Census (as big as Cambridge + Somerville combined), and we are not sure when population would plateau but percent growth seemed to be slower as Frisco becomes more mature.

Some of my reasonings on why Houston and DFW are overrated:

Even though Houston and the DFW region are more liberal than Texas as a whole, with some Houston lawmakers proposing a basic income programme for its poorest residents, they are nonetheless still in Texas, so they are bound by some of the draconian policies and ordinances the Texas government imposes. Some of them include the strict statewide abortion ban, book bans (and later maybe book burnings like what was seen in 1933), no protections for LGBTQIA2S+ individuals, requiring age verification to watch pornographic sites with Pornhub pulling out of Texas, and the continued use of capital punishment and corporal punishment at public schools. Given the fact both Houston and Dallas are part of Texas, that also meant they use the Texas power grid (aka ERCOT), which is notorious for reliability issues. What's ironic is despite this, Texas electricity is still more expensive on average per kwh than neighbouring states and the state of Washington (which uses hydropower), but less expensive than my state of residence (Massachusetts) and on the lower side for the US. That meant if there is an impending winter storm or heat wave, then good luck, as you might go out of power, reminiscent to the 2021 power outage which killed hundreds. To avoid those looming power outages, you will have to go solar and specifically, buy a solar battery storage backup plan so you could enjoy your electricity during one of these outages. Also, even though Houston and Dallas has several prestigious hospitals such as the Houston Methodist Hospital, UT Southwestern Medical Center, and Baylor University Medical Center, Texas has not yet adopted medicaid expansion and as a result, Texas has some of the highest uninsured rates of any state in the US. In contrast, the percent of insured residents in most OECD countries is either at or close to 100%.

Even though the crime rates are far lower than some of the worst offenders (looking at you, St Louis), crime rates tend to be higher than that of the US average (for the city proper) and on line with many major US cities like DC, Philly, Chicago,  Nashville, and Atlanta (Austin safer than both), and if you wanted to escape from crime, then you are better off looking into the affluent suburban areas, which still have some crime (in fact, several days ago, there was an armed robbery attempt at the HEB in Sugar Land). Pollution levels are also high, due to the sheer volume of traffic and relatively low EV/hybrid adoption, as well as the volume of oil refineries in the region, and especially in Waco and Midlands/Odessa. Houston/Dallas poverty rate at slightly below 20% puts it on line with other major US cities, however.

Another negative aspect of Houston and Dallas has to be the sprawl and the heavy traffic from 7 am to 10 pm with traffic being more heavily pronounced during rush hours. Even though there are so many highways being built compared to Boston (which only has I-90, I-95/128, I-93, US-1, Route 1A, Route 2) and each highway has more lanes (like 4-6 on each side compared to 3-4), the traffic still felt more insane than in Boston. Even though Boston has heavy rush hour traffic, outside of rush hour (in the noontime and weekends), you would probably see traffic jams in I-93 (between Downtown and Savin Hill Dorchester), and maybe Route 1A Sumner Tunnel and I-90 (in some parts of the day). I have driven around Boston for years and found Boston to be far easier in trying to merge into the freeway and change lanes as supposed with Houston or Dallas where with the constant influx of cars, it has been very hard and takes at least a good few seconds to merge onto the freeway. 

That said, during rush hour, Boston's traffic congestion is terrible, owing to its density and the perpetual MBTA woes in the past several years, but nonetheless, there is no 26 lane freeway in Boston. I would typically take 5-10 minutes to crawl half a mile in Boston during rush hour and sometimes even 15, but driving has been safer.

In fact, the widest freeway (the Katy Freeway I-10) has 16 lanes just for the highway and if you include arterial/frontage roads, then the lane count goes up to 26. Yet, the traffic is still insane during rush hour.

Even though Massachusetts drivers are quite belligerent, Texas drivers are also very belligerent and have a narcissistic attitude, and would horn you in an attempt to get you to merge onto the freeway, even if the freeway drivers are not keen on you merging in. Another egregious aspect has to be in many suburban stroads. You might have to wait several seconds or potentially even a minute to merge onto the main road. And what's worse is turning right on the main road and then in several hundred feet, turning left. That meant you now have to merge 3-4 different lanes, which is an incredibly risky maneuver and not only could it involve altercations via the use of horns, there could be an accident as well. It is not very safe to walk on the streets as most suburban streets don't have any sidewalks and you might have to trek through the grass to avoid getting hit by cars. There is also no pedestrian crossing in many streets and coupled in with the high speeds on suburban roads, crossing the road might become suicide without checking beforehand.

Most of all, the public transportation is abominable for a city of the size and might of Houston and Dallas. Despite the fact both cities have a light rail and a bus network, none of these are considered reliable, and there is no heavy rail of any sort. Even though the DFW area does include a commuter rail system, Houston has no such thing, and many suburban cities like Sugar Land and Frisco have next to 0 public transportation and are car dependent for the most part. Texas's public transportation is marked with ignominy according to many pundits, and we don't stop there. One city that took public transportation to its extreme is Arlington. A city with 400k but zero public transit of any kind is a recipe for disaster. Arlington VA and MA both have public transportation, with Arlington VA having a fully fledged heavy rail system that is generally reliable. Public transportation in the US has been terrible, and even though Boston's MBTA is only behind the WMATA (DC) and NYC's MTA, it is still far behind many European and Asian systems. I have visited Sofia Bulgaria (one of the poorest cities in the European Union), and the metro is not only new and modernised, it is also far cleaner and far more reliable than that of the MBTA. Budapest's metro has implemented an app system that allows you to buy passes through the app and scan them using a QR code to enter the metro. Prague, Warsaw, Krakow, Bucharest, Zagreb, and Tallinn has better public transit than Boston. Heck, even non-EEA cities like Belgrade have decent public transportation systems even compared with Boston. Dubai's metro costs half of that of Boston, yet has far more frequency, rarely breaks down (during my time there), is far cleaner and more modern, and is also autonomous.

Don't let me have to mention Western Europe because Western Europe (Milan, Munich, Paris, Berlin, Madrid, Barcelona, London, Amsterdam, Vienna, Zurich, Bern, Stuttgart, Copenhagen, Stockholm, etc) would have far better transit systems than Boston.

In fact, driving is also terrible. I have been stuck in traffic several times whilst in Texas, with the most infamous being on I-45 on December 7 (Palmer TX) because there was a major truck accident that resulted in the whole highway being closed, and luckily, because there is a grassy path to the arterial road, many people (including me) decided to cross it, and overall, it has caused a backup which wasted 40-50 minutes of my time. And let's not forget the toll prices are insane and there are many toll roads. Massachusetts only has one toll road (I-90) plus 2 more toll bridges/tunnels (Sumner Tunnel/Callahan Tunnel and Tobin Bridge) and if you are in Boston, then chances are you could completely avoid tolls. In MA, it would cost between 10-20 USD (depending on EZPass status) to drive the entire length of I-90 and it costs $1.25 to commute one-way through the select tunnels/bridges. There are no tolls on I-95 or I-93. Connecticut doesn't have tolls, and even though NY and NJ are notorious for the GWB, Lincoln, and Holland Tunnel tolls ($15 from NJ to NY), many of the tolls are more sane than some of those seen in Texas per mile.

I am not sure how the job market is in Texas, but in Houston and in the DFW, there are a lot of job opportunities (just like said above), but not sure how salary fares in Texas. Based on what I heard, doctors get paid better in Texas than in Northeastern states, even though most others (including SWE, etc) offer a lower salary and Texas still has the $7.25 federal minimum wage which is laughably low in today's standards.

Having a lot of tech opportunities is especially good, for someone like me, of whom I am a SWE, recent graduate, part-time tech YouTuber, aspiring tech entrepreneur, and future PhD student.

Even though there is no income nor corporate/business tax in Texas, Texas has other issues, such as the 13th highest sales tax at 8.19% and the 6th highest property tax rate (still lower than Connecticut/New Jersey, which impose some of the highest income AND property taxes). As for the property tax, it heavily depends on the municipality, county, or HOA community. That being said, even though some places like the Woodlands doesn't have as many HOA houses, many Texas suburbs are overran by HOA communities, with most Single Family Houses in Sugar Land and Frisco imposing an HOA fee of less than $100 a month. That being said, despite that, houses are in the low end even in the most affluent towns. A 1500 sqft house will cost around 300k and 400k respectively in Sugar Land and Frisco, whilst a 2000 sqft house will cost around 375 and 500k respectively. Rents for a 1-2 bedroom 800 sqft apartment (even in the 2010s/2020s builds) have been around $1500, which is a lot lower than in many Massachusetts communities, where 700 sqft new cookie cutter apartments in Framingham still routinely cost around $2500. I have even seen several 3000 sqft houses in Sugar Land costing below $500k, which is absolutely insane for such an affluent suburb. 

https://www.apartments.com/stella-at-riverstone-sugar-land-tx/kr3j45c/

https://www.apartments.com/brea-frisco-frisco-tx/ytbwjlv/

That being said, despite the low housing prices, proximity to amenities/jobs, racial diversity in many of the affluent suburbs (high Asian American population), median household income above 150k in many of the zip codes, and decently ranked schools like Clements, many of the suburbs are very generic and are a soulless cesspool of strip malls, HOA communities, pools, theme parks and endless traffic. However, Plano, Frisco, the Woodlands, Sugar Land, and Southlake each have a mall, and each of them have an Apple Store, comparable to many of the high end malls in MA like Burlington, Natick, and Prudential. However, because of patent trolls, Apple had to shutter their stores in Plano and Frisco, ironically. In many HOA communities, the lot size is only 5-7k sqft, which is rather small, but in Massachusetts, many older builds in urban areas have this same lot size, but with a house of this size (3000 sqft), you'd probably be expecting at least half an acre or even one acre, and hence, that could be the culprit for the unusually low housing prices. For me personally, I do want less lot size (even though I care about privacy) because I hate having to mow the lawn and if I am outside, I would probably be at least a good few miles away from home.

Another negative facet of Dallas and Houston is the volume of roads in poor condition. I have experienced at least a few dozen potholes whilst I was there, coupled with the rather ugly scenery outside of Downtown, with run down dilapidated houses and quite atrocious roads. That said, roads in the wealthiest suburbs like Frisco and Sugar Land are much better than that of the city and I am amazed by the road quality. Not only are there potholes in many of the roads, there are also bumps as well, but bad roads are kind of a nationwide phenomenon anyways. There are a lot of the skyscrapers in Downtown Houston and Dallas, which does look quite good, but once you get out of the inner circle, then suddenly, it starts to become far more suburban again, with 2-3 storey buildings and sometimes even single storey. Urban planning is also bonkers, with much of the land in the downtown part being used for massive parking lots or straight up empty instead of for one parking garage/underground parking and several mixed-use houses. Even though Houston and Dallas pride themselves as having ample parking and being car-centric, the parking tickets can be quite expensive (I am not sure what they are as there is no dedicated page unlike the Boston and Cambridge municipal sites), and parking can be quite expensive in certain places.

That being said, despite the fact there are negatives about Houston and Dallas, there are some benefits as well, such as the lower cost of housing (especially if you live in the suburbs where houses tend to be on the lower side of the scale compared to the city centre). Despite the lower cost of housing and even groceries in general, groceries tend to be on the more expensive side compared to Northeastern states as many Northeastern states have stores like Wegmans and Market Basket, where prices are lower than a typical StopAndShop, Star Market, or ShopRite. HEB is one of the most renowned grocery chains in Texas. Gas prices are also low, at 2.60 per gallon, which is some of the lowest in the country. Tesla Supercharger prices are also comparatively low, averaging 0.33 cents per kwh. According to the AAA, Texas has the 5th most affordable cost/kwh average charging prices at 0.276 cents.

Another benefit has to go to job opportunities (just like mentioned above), the no income/business tax rate, and the weather at winter (even though winter weathers still range between 40-55 F). However, despite that, summers typically see triple degree Fahrenheit (38 C+) temperatures for at least 1-2 months straight, which could be unbearable, and even more so if the power grid is trash. That is definitely worse than California, which even though there have been a few notable wildfires since 2019, weather is far more moderate in California than in Texas. Despite the relatively ok to slightly cold weather during winter, there are yearly hurricanes in Houston and tornados are quite pervasive in Texas. One more benefit has to be the ethnic diversity, even in the suburbs, with a lot of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Indian, Thai, Pakistani, Italian, French, German, Polish, Russian, African, and Mexican restaurants, even in the suburbs of Houston and Dallas such as Sugar Land and Frisco. Sure, the suburbs of NYC (NJ), DC (NOVA),  and Californian/Washingtonian suburbs might have a lot of ethnic diversity, but in the suburbs of Boston, there are relatively fewer authentic Asian restaurants compared with the city. Most of the Asian restaurants in the Boston area are in Boston, Cambridge, Brookline, Quincy, Malden, and Lowell. Also, Sugar Land does include a 99 Ranch. In Massachusetts, only Quincy has a 99 Ranch. There are several H-Mart and even C-Mart as well as 88 Supermarket in MA and Quincy as Kan Man.

And lastly, another benefit of Houston and Dallas is the entertainment scene as there are a lot of venues and even amusement parks. Fun fact, Universal Studios is planning to build a location in Frisco and who knows how the real estate market would react with this. Also, Rice, the most prestigious in Houston, and Southern Methodist, the most prestigious in Dallas, are nowhere near as prestigious as Ivy adjacent schools, and in STEM, UT Austin beats both of them out.

TL;DR: Some reasons for me writing this diatribe was not only that I visited Houston and Dallas, my (23M) parents (74M, 63F) are planning to immigrate from Vietnam to the US in the late 2020s and retire, and my father (a former hospital executive/health minister of Vietnam) is planning to move to Texas, specifically Sugar Land, because a lot of his friends live there. My mother however, has a younger sister living in Worcester, and she is planning otherwise, despite the fact my oldest sister (34F) currently resides in Texas. I am not moving to Texas anytime.

Dallas County has authorized the purchase of three Tesla Model 3 vehicles to be used by the local police. It’s the latest example of electric vehicles gaining popularity with law enforcement.

Tesla vehicles have become the go-to EV for police departments around the world. Many have started adding Tesla Model 3s to their fleets, most recently [the NYPD](https://electrek.co/2021/07/07/nypd-buys-tesla-model-3-electric-patrol-vehicle/).

Last year, the Model Y started to gain momentum.

Fremont police and the Spokane Police Department both [bought Model Ys to use as patrol vehicles](https://electrek.co/2020/12/16/tesla-model-y-help-electrify-two-us-police-departments/), and [Boulder’s police department also went with the electric SUV.](https://electrek.co/2021/08/16/tesla-model-y-cheaper-police-patrol-car-6-18-months-boulder-sheriff/)

Any type of use that requires a lot of mileage is going to benefit greatly from the gas and maintenance savings of going electric. Police patrol vehicles fit that use case.

Last week the Dallas County Commissioners approved the purchase of three Tesla Model 3 Performance vehicles for use by the local police.

They want to use them as police vehicles, but they haven’t had the time to validate the Tesla Model 3 based on their requirements. For fear of the backlog becoming too long, they decided to purchase the vehicles right away and place them in their reserve unit (via [NBC](https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/dallas-county-to-purchase-3-teslas-for-law-enforcement-use/2944306/)):

>*A briefing given to the County Commissioners states “as a result of the ongoing semiconductor microchip and supply chain issues, the length of time to determine if vehicles meet the replacement criteria guidelines could potentially result in ordering banks from the manufacturers to be closed. The recommendation is to purchase the three Tesla Model 3 Performance electric vehicles and have them placed as part of the ASC reserve unit.*

2. The diversity here is really cool. My neighborhood is filled with people who look completely different from one another and everyone gets along great! Except for the neighbors who occasionally play music super loud on weeknights at midnight 🙄
3. Traffic is bad. Not as bad as Austin. It's a big city. Traffic is inevitable. 
4. I didn't know I was a huge hockey fan until I went to a Stars game. It's honestly one of my favorite parts of living here. 
5. DFW is a fantastic place for career building. I work in the MEP industry and we have lots of opportunities here for business growth. 
6. Whiterock lake is a treasure. I go there about every weekend to go running. 
7. Sadly, many places around here are eyesores. We live off of Beltline. It is one among many ugly streets. Not bad a bad street (like Harry Hines), just hard to look at. 
8. Flying from DFW/Love is soooo convenient! 
9. It's hard to identify what Dallas' brand is. Suburbia? JFK? ☠ 
10. I still and will always hate the Cowboys. 🙃",Dallas,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/192s1j2/thoughts_on_living_in_dfw_for_15_years/,1/9/2024 22:43,310,154,texas

I live at highland park west lemon apartments in Dallas and since august of 2021 I have had my car stolen out of the garage and since then I have had my catalytic converter stolen THREE times in 4 months. I even bought the cage that is welded on to the convertor to prevent theft and they cut right through it.

16keym1,Car insurance,"
Hey Reddit community,

I recently purchased a 2019 used vehicle priced at $25k and I'm on the hunt for affordable car insurance options. To my surprise, every single insurance place I've contacted is quoting me no less than $450-500 per month, which seems absolutely insane to me.

A little background: I haven't had any speeding tickets in over 7 years, but I did have an accident 3 years ago. However, I expected my rates to have improved since then, but it seems that's not the case.

I find this price range extremely unaffordable, and I'm sure there are others who have faced similar situations. Does anyone have advice or recommendations on where I can find more reasonable car insurance rates for my 2019 vehicle? Any tips or experiences you can share would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.

ghep6f,Data Question - Tax Breaks and Return on Incentives for Businesses,"I'm curious about the evidence of the payoffs of luring big businesses to Dallas with tax incentives.

I've heard most of the arguments: big companies bring lots of jobs, lots of jobs means lots of people who increase sales revenues, property taxes, etc., which provide public funding and make the city more attractive even to people who dont work for the big company.

Where would one start to begin to analyze whether this is true or not? Is there any data? Have studies been done, especially in Dallas?

&#x200B;

I ask obviously because of Elon Musk's [recent tweet about Tesla production relocating to Texas](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1259162367285317633?s=20) (maybe), and how every [Texas leader](https://twitter.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1259210994812882945?s=20)/[Regional leader](https://twitter.com/JudgeClayJ/status/1259297820651249667?s=20)/[Dallas leader](https://twitter.com/Johnson4Dallas/status/1259238559355191297?s=20) started publicly salivating.

But I hesitate because, Uber was supposed to bring thousands of jobs, and [they're maybe not on track](https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2020/02/dmn-buries-the-lead-on-ubers-hiring-failures/), even before the coronavirus. ATT was given money by City Council to remove streets downtown for...more office space and commercial space that they own? Do we know if Toyota has helped the regional economy at all? 

&#x200B;

*(On a personal observation, it just seems silly to give money/not ask for tax money from a company that sends its profits to shareholders outside of Dallas.

w59wzm,A Tesla Tunnel from the airport to downtown is a slap in the face to all residents.,"San Antonio needs inexpensive mass transit.

17ru0oc,"27 year old woman, trying to buy a new vehicle and getting swindled at every car dealership I go to. Any Recs?","*Final Edit:* I bought a car in Austin this weekend! 22 Mercedes GLA250 from car max and it was a great experience. I love the car and I don’t know why I didn’t go to car max earlier. 

To answer some questions, the car dealership that I had the worst experience with was Carvix in San Antonio. I was shopping for a 21 GLE. In the out the door numbers, the sales guy added $3,000 worth of extended warranty. I said I didn’t want it and he said it was required since they repainted the car. Then I asked for the car to be registered in my home state of Florida, he said it’s required to register in Texas. I told him that’s not true and after a little back and forth he brought out the final numbers with the $3000 “required” extended warranty, taxes, fees, and a whopping $708 in registration fees. I pushed back and told him the $708 isn’t accurate. He went to his sales manager who said he was from Florida and it is. I showed him the dmv website and an out the door offer from Mercedes on the same vehicle with the registration fee. I told him it’s hard to trust anything on this paper when you guys aren’t being truthful about this. Sales Manager came out and said it includes a $500 national dealer fee and if I didn’t want to pay it I didn’t have to buy the car. I walked out and made this post.

At car max they didn’t add any “required warranty” they waived sales tax, title, and registration fees so I can register in Florida and transfer my plates from my old vehicle. I’m in Florida for the holidays so it’s perfect for
Me. Thanks for all the advice and for the people offering to come with me to the dealership. Many of you are just very kind and it’s really appreciated.


Edit: took some advice from this post. Drove to Austin this weekend and am currently looking at Model X and Y 21 Tesla Models and 21 GLEs. The experience has been nice here in Austin and I’ve been to 5 dealerships so far. 

Edit: my ideal car is a 2021 or 2022 GLE 250, but also open to a mid brand like Toyota or Mazda if it’s 2023 or 2024. Crossovers only. Thank you guys for the help.

just moved to San Antonio a month ago and quickly realized I needed a new vehicle. The last 2 weeks I’ve been going to dealership to dealership to test drive vehicles and feel like I’m getting swindled left and right. 

This evening, I was at a dealership ready to purchase a 21 GLE. I questioned an enormously large registration fee that no one could explain. I just wanted an answer. The manager came out and said “listen this is this the price, if you don’t like it you don’t get the car.” I told him there was no reason to be rude and I’m asking a question about money I’m paying.

It left such a bitter taste in my mouth, especially when an hour earlier I heard this same manager taking thousands off the price of a car with an older couple and saying “just so you know we’re not making any money off of this but we wanted to help you guys out.” I walked out at the last minute and decided to not buy because I just hated the interaction.

This car buying process has been so stressful, any reputable dealers you’d suggest? I’m open to Mercedes, Mazda, or any other cars with equal value.",sanantonio,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanantonio/comments/17ru0oc/27_year_old_woman_trying_to_buy_a_new_vehicle_and/,11/10/2023 2:33,210,332,texas

15d1ky2,How well do you know SA history?,"Or, ""All the important stuff that isn't the Battle of the Alamo.""

For the newbies and oldies alike, here's some lesser known history about the city from a native Tejano:

(I posted in another thread, but I'll share here for all). 

1. San Antonio used to be the capital of Texas during the Spanish and Mexican eras. 


2. It was also ""Hollywood"" during the Golden Age of the Silent Film era, thanks to its established vaudeville scene. Charlie Chaplin used to hang out at the Hot Wells Springs. (Note: when we had an electric trolley system between downtown and the Southside) 


3. The first Academy Award for Best Picture, ""Wings"" was filmed here in the 1920s. They used actual veteran pilots of WW1 and hundreds of soldiers as extras at Kelly Field.
 
...

4. Named after San Antonio de Padua, a Portuguese Saint. (You can invoke his name to find lost things), but the indigenous name is Yanaguana. 

5. Originally, there were various Coahuiltecan tribes that called the San Antonio River (Yanaguana) and San Pedro Creek home, with villages scattered around downtown. The main Coahuiltecan tribe here was the Payaya. 

6. Cabeza de Vaca was the first European and his companion Estevanico (Esteban de Dorantes) was the first African to explore the region in the 1500s. They became healers. It would be another 100 or so years before the Spanish sent official expeditions. 

7. San Antonio is one of four sacred spots to the Coahuiltecan tribes, together known as the Four Sacred Springs. They're only recently gaining recognition (and also threatened by sprawl/pollution). 

...

8. Two major battles happened here in what is known as the First Texas Revolution (this isn't going to be in your history books) against Napoleonic Spain. 

9. The Battle of Medina, the bloodiest battle in Texas history, and the Battle of Alazan Creek (the one that kicked it all off). This included veterans of the American Revolution, many of whom were Irish. 

10. After the Battle of Medina, Tejano men were executed in the Plaza de Armas for weeks, the women were forced to cook for the occupiers, and children were left in the cold. SA was heavily depopulated during this time. (Add this to your haunted stories).

...

11. San Antonio played a critical role during the Mexican Revolution, WW1, and WW2 due to German heritage. 

12. ""Cinco de Mayo"" isn't just some Mexican holiday adopted by the U.S. The Mexican victory over the French was won because of a Tejano, General Ignacio Zaragoza was the nephew of Juan Seguin (Tejano Revolutionary). 

...

13. SA has a very deep history with central and Northern Mexico, and it's seen in our vibrant Mexican heritage. It should also be noted that we have a strong Tejano heritage that is also very distinct. That's why San Antonio has always been a major city, over 300 years old. 

...

14. We have a Science and Technology Museum (SAMSAT) located at the Port SA's Tech Center. They have a tesla coil. 

15. Many of the patents in the devices we take for granted are shown there. 

16. SA was a major hub in the 60s to the Space Race and supported NASA, especially with Biomedical research. We still have many top research facilities like Southwest Research Institute. 

17. ""Datapoint"", the company, which was located in the Medical Center, was a major facilitator of computer science innovation and drew up the very first prototypes for the first personal computer, mobile phones, and more. 

18. In 1916, The San Antonio Light predicted that the city would be “the most important military aviation center in the U.S."" SA continues to be a major aerospace, military, and tech hub.

197ryp0,Car advice,"So, after my Kia being stolen for a 3rd time (don't get me started) it was finally enough damage to have my insurance total it. I'm actually getting enough money to not only pay off the car, but to also have a $3000 dollar down payment on another vehicle. So I need opinions on what some good cars are, that will won't fall apart on me. 

I'm obviously staying away from Kia and Hyundai. I like the smaller SUV type cars, I'm only one person so I don't need like a Ford expedition or anything like that.

while im asking, why is there always huge holes where previous lane lines were? is it not just paint? i noticed nearly foot deep lines of holes on some of these old guidelines, all along the highway the old guidelines have crazy holes and dips and your car will bump along the whole way down the lane. are they drilling the lines out instead of covering them with tarmac? it’s not just old roads but quite a few newer that have the most insane potholes the old ones don’t even have. really what is going ON in this city?!",sanantonio,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanantonio/comments/1c56w0k/these_potholes_are_criminal/,4/16/2024 4:07,52,30,texas

16dqzmu,The things you see at night.,"I worked nights this week, in fact I just woke up. The things you see at 2am.

So I work for a national company and my hub where I keep my inventory is over near South Park Mall. I got to work about midnight all week. After doing some admin stuff and getting my truck loaded, I would leave my hub about 2-2:30am to make my rounds.

So I get on 35 about 2:30am at Poteet on Tuesday and start heading North. I immediately see like 20-30 people walking South down the service road. All with backpacks on and carrying small bags. I could see the glows of cell phone up to their heads as if they were on the phone. As I continue I see this double decker bus with few marking parked at some depot before you get to Zarzamora and another 20-30 people milling around the parking lot, looking at phones or talking on phones. There are no other cars there. As I continue past I see another 30+ people walking down the service road towards Zarzamora. All with bags and backpacks, phones at work.

I encounter this same scenario about 2:45 this am. Bus sitting at depot with no people but this time the entire group is in a long line. Some were approaching Zarzamora and some had continued past. 

In months past I have seen many other people bring dropped off at random locations as far north as San Marcos. Always between 2-3:30am. 

Are these people being dumped? I mean I would have expected to see a few cars picking people up if they were people returning from a trip dont you think?",sanantonio,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanantonio/comments/16dqzmu/the_things_you_see_at_night/,9/9/2023 0:16,87,31,texas

sa7awu,Elon Musk wants to build tunnels under San Antonio - Explained,"Some of the common questions/complaints I have seen are: 

Why not build out mass transit options? -- But what about the Edwards Aquifer? -- I don't understand the purpose this serves -- I was seriously underwhelmed with the current Vegas tunnel -- Tunnels look like death traps -- Fk Elon! -- Yadda yadda

\--Two of the most important aspects in business is (1) Proof of Concept and (2) Scalability. 

(1) Proof of Concept - The Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) Loop is a three-station transportation system consisting of 1.7 miles of tunnel Vegas convention center that took about a year to make.

	\*People are confused that this is a proof of concept to demonstrate the feasibility of the project.

(2) Scalability - Now that Boring has proven their Boring tunnel concept in terms of transportation efficiency, profitability, and more....they will be moving forward with scaling this project. They all ready have a deal in place to scale the LVCC tunnel to University of Nevada, Las Vegas Strip, and Allegiant Stadium. (Source: [https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/the-boring-company-tunnel-las-vegas/](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/the-boring-company-tunnel-las-vegas/))

	\*Hopefully, you can now start to see what the future potential is for SAN ANTONIO! 

\--As stated in the article, Boring Company wants to ferry passengers down nine-mile long underground tunnels connecting downtown to San Antonio International Airport. But don't think so small San Antonio, soon those tunnels will connect to UTSA and even go all the way to Austin! Imagine going in tunnel to Austin in 15 minutes....Simply amazing!

&#x200B;

Here are some Benefits of Tunnels - 

\--Unlimited Capacity: There is no practical limit to how many layers of tunnels can be built, so any current or future capacity outcome can be achieved. This flexibility contrasts with a surface system where adding a lane to the road is often difficult

	\*It's very hard to build more roads on the surface because you're operating on a 2D surface whereas when building tunnels, you're operating in 3D where you can go deeper

\--Minimal Use of Land: Tunnels minimize the use of valuable surface land. Tunnels also do not conflict with currently operating transportation systems, such as roads and sidewalks

	\*There would be some stations/spots where vehicles would come up/down from below but most operations are underground, so they don't use valuable surface land

\--Weatherproof Operation: Rain, snow, wind, and surface temperatures do not affect system operation

	\*Nuff said

\--Minimal Surface Impact: Tunnel construction and operation do not create any discernible surface noise or vibration. Tunnel construction and operation are invisible, silent, and undetectable

	\*The way tunnels operate, because it's deep enough, the impact of tunneling is not felt at ground level - This is not like where you're in New York City on the street and you can feel the subway underneath - The way Boring does it, you would not feel/hear anything happening underneath

\--Future Expansion: It is much simpler to extend a tunnel-based system than a surface-based system

	\*Easy to expand a tunnel-based system vs a road or rail-based system

\--Well....You may ask why we've gone away from tunnels as they've been around for over 100 years. -- Currently, tunnels are really expensive to dig, with many projects costing between $100 million and $1 billion per mile. In order to make vast tunnel networks feasible, tunneling costs must be reduced. Boring is all ready around about $10M per mile. (And they are marching towards bringing that to $5M per mile!)

\*\*\*Summary of Why Tunnels? = Unlimited layers, Weatherproof, Can't see/hear/feel construction on surface, No divided communities (unlike freeways), & No street closures\*\*\*

\--For concerns with Safety -

Fire? The Boring tunnel has a robust ventilation system that can move 400,000 cubic feet of air per minute in either direction down the tunnels, which would allow passengers and drivers to evacuate safely. Also, for less serious incidents, Boring has a tow vehicle to extract broken-down cars.

(Again, remember that humans have had tunnels for over 100 years. Also, all of the safety measures have to be reviewed/approved by engineers, city council, and more.)

\--But what about the Edwards Aquifer? The Boring tunnels start about 30 feet deep where Ed Aquifer is 100s of feet below the surface. Remember, there are many engineers and the city has to approve these things - They aren't just blind to this stuff - In a nutshell, Ed Aquifer is no concern.

Cost - 

\--Why are our tax dollars going to this waste of a project?!? -- One of the best things about this Boring tunnel is the total amount of our tax dollars going into Boring tunnels will be = $0.00! -- How? -- Boring actually funds the entire tunnel system themselves so the people of San Antonio don't pay nada!!

\--How much would a trip cost? The cost would be comparable or cheaper than current public transportation fees

\--Remember, these tunnels are much better than subway system as you go directly to your destination. You don't have to stop at each and every station. This is huge! -- The Teslas driving in the tunnels will be automated. (No doubt in my mind)

\*Note on Hyperloop - Be aware that Hyperloop is looking ultra distant into the future! Hyperloop is an ultra-high speed underground public transportation system where passengers will move over 300+ mph within vacuum-sealed tunnels -- Whereas Loop is used for shorter intra-city routes, Hyperloop will be used for longer inter-city routes.

\--Cool Note: They design the tunnels using all-electric tunneling equipment, which results in cleaner tunnels with simpler ventilation requirements due to lack of diesel fumes.

\--I'm going to end it here as I could go on and on. I hope some questions/concerns were answered or at least get people to think a little more open about the opportunity at hand.

\--Remember, people used to say you can't fly a rocket into orbit and land it back on earth...Now, SpaceX does it on the regular with no other company even attempting this. People used to say Electric Vehicles (EVs) were stupid....Now, Tesla/EVs are the future and have turned the entire car industry upside down.

\*The above is due to Elon Musk. \*

San Antonio should be ecstatic for the opportunity of Musk bringing tunnels into our city in order to improve upon it. 

I'm actually saddened with the response in yesterday's post of Musk/Boring coming into San Antonio because San Antonio needs this...we need more of this kind of stuff. I really hope the city of San Antonio becomes a bit more open to the idea. Let's not close ourselves off from one of the greatest people of our time.

v44p7w,Advice for those struggling with housing costs,"We have posts almost daily complaining about the cost to rent/own. This is going to get some downvotes, but I want to speak to those who actually want to know what to do rather than just be cynical on the internet.

&#x200B;

* **Why are prices for renting and owning so high?** Mostly because there are a ton of people moving here and because we aren't building enough new housing with enough density. I was at an event last week with an economist from the Fed who had tons of charts showing the influx in population relative to the building of new housing. The cost of housing is going to be an issue for the foreseeable future.
* **How does building new housing control cost? Aren't new rentals and houses built super swanky and expensive?**

Think of all the rentals and houses in San Antonio on a scale from completely unlivable, run down, ok quality, kinda nice, nice, really nice, luxury, ultra luxury. All housing without rehab eventually slides down that scale and will command lower rents/selling prices unless someone puts a lot of money to make it nice again.

Yes, all new housing is built at least ""nice"" or better. No builder builds a slum. Let's focus just on rents, but it's true for houses as well. Without that new ""nice"" apartment, the people willing to pay ""nice"" apartment rent are fighting over the other ""nice"" places and maybe event having to settle for a ""kinda nice"" place. The people who can afford ""nice"" but can only find ""kinda nice"" take up an apartment that other people who can only afford ""kinda nice"" can't live in. So the ""kinda nice"" people fight over the ""kinda nice"" apartments and end up possible settling for an ""ok quality"" place, and this continues down the line. As new ""nice"", ""luxury"", and ""ultra luxury"" apartments get built, it relieves demand all the way down the line for apartments and therefore helping to reduce upward pressure on rents even at the low end of the rental market.

* **Are home prices high because megacorporations are buying all the homes?** Maybe, but probably not. A company like Blackrock can't make money without renters/buyers for the homes they are buying. They are just reacting to the fact that San Antonio has a ton of people moving here. They are providing liquidity to the market. For all the people complaining about buying, there are a lot of sellers in San Antonio enjoying life because they were able to sell their place pretty easily. Even if they are super evil and causing houses prices to go up, what are you going to do about it? It's not useful to complain about things. you can't control, let's focus on what do we control.

**Here's my advice for folks who really cannot afford to rent or buy a home in San Antonio -** I could be wrong, but economically I think Texas is where California was in the early 80s and we are going to have a massive population and economic boom for the next few decades. Companies are moving here, its favorable to business, the weather is nice (compared to the north), and the cost of living is lower than a lot of other places in the country.

1. **If you are in an industry where you wage growth is capped (teaching, public service, nursing, social worker, etc.)**: first, you're awesome. Society needs people in your profession and it sucks that the incentives in this country pay you like shit, but that's not going to change any time soon. Take the easy way out and make plans to move to somewhere that is smaller or not growing as fast. Life in a smaller town/city is way cooler than it used to be because of the internet, and many smaller cities are upgrading their downtowns/parks to make them super livable. You can struggle here competing against the people working for Tesla, or you can buy an awesome house in a great community with nice people and enjoy your life. Yes, I know we need teachers/nurses/etc. here, but they aren't all going to take this advice and will choose to live life on hard mode.
2. **If you are in an industry where you can grow your salary (such as working for any large company):** focus on growing your career and try to hang on here or in another big city in Texas. The reason why people in California can afford so much here is because they lived in California in a magical era when salaries and housing went crazy. That's very likely to happen here, but you have to be here to make it happen, and you need to be smart about your career. If you work for a big company, you need to be playing the game to advance your career and often jump companies every few years to get big pay bumps. Ramit Sethi on twitter has a ton of great resources about how to ask for raises at work. At big companies, the person you're asking a raise from is not paying out of their pocket, so it's really not that hard to get a yes if you come prepared. Especially right now when hiring is tough.

I recognize there are other solutions. We can get new laws, new politicians, etc. Let's fight for all that, but I'm just speaking to the individuals on here genuinely trying to figure out what to do in the short term. Complaining on reddit is fun but it's not really solving anyone's problems.",sanantonio,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanantonio/comments/v44p7w/advice_for_those_struggling_with_housing_costs/,6/3/2022 17:40,0,18,texas

16lu22e,"What is the worst kind of vehicle in Austin, and why is it a white Tesla with California plates?","I’m downtown and exiting a parallel parking space. I throw my turn signal on and while I’m waiting for traffic to pass, a White Tesla with California plates pulls up next to me with his turn signal on and then goes PAST me, stops, and throws it into reverse gear like he’s going to reverse into my spot. 

(Edit for clarity: it’s normal to stop behind the vehicle that is exiting the parking space, not in front of them)

Who the hell does that? How does he expect me to leave the spot? I’m now supposed to exit my spot and go around him too, in moderately heavy traffic? 

Inevitably another vehicle pulls up behind the Tesla (alongside me) and I am now totally locked in. Tesla driver gets out of his car and starts shouting at the other driver that he should have figured out the situation and stopped earlier. Other vehicle drives off (around the Tesla) eventually when there’s a gap in traffic. 

I decide to just sit there for a couple of minutes for the entertainment value, but not 10 seconds later another vehicle pulls up behind the Tesla and this time it’s a Cruise driverless vehicle. Now it’s serious, since clearly the computer has more patience than either of us. I laid on the horn for about 30 seconds until the Tesla had the good sense to go around the block.

1ica5qr,"A woman followed me for 5 miles from Round Rock to Pflugerville, to confront me after nearly running me off the road","Yesterday I visited Round Rock to purchase some furniture from IKEA. On my way back home, a car attempting to cross 2 lanes immediately after leaving a parking lot, forced me out of my lane. I anticipated the situation and avoided the collision.

I didn’t think much of it after instinctively hitting my horn to alert the driver that they were encroaching on my lane.

For the next 5 miles(12 minutes), I was unknowingly followed to my next destination, Target in Pflugerville. 

Upon exiting my car and playing peek-a-boo with my son, while attempting to unbuckle his car seat, I noticed a car boxing me in. It was an older white woman. I couldn’t understand what she was saying, but she was clearly trying to get my attention. I turned to face her, and after asking her politely how I could assist, she flurried a barrage of accusations at me about driving too fast. 

Still not sure of who she was, I immediately stopped unbuckling my son. My wife didn’t notice the exchange yet and continued to walk across to the driver’s side of the car. 

The woman then stated that she was “the car from the Exxon station,” which confused me for a bit because I haven’t been to a gas station in a long time.

When she noticed my wife, she immediately directed the conversation towards her as though I no longer existed. My wife did not engage.

I chose to go silent after realizing who she was. Though I don’t believe that I have a threatening look or demeanor, I present as Black, and I am very aware of the way some people view Black people in this country. Personally, I have been accused of looking angry more often than I’d like.

After the initial shock, I pulled out my phone to record the woman boxing my car in. You can’t see it in the video, but I’m making a peace sign while recording. She returns the peace sign and then flips it into a middle finger before driving out of Stone Hill Town Center.

When I finally look back at my son, he has the most blank stare on his face that I’ve ever seen. Thankfully, he’s too young to remember this.

Stay safe out there. ✌🏾

It'll likely be a 73ish mile commute at least for the first few months, but at best be a 65ish commute from Belton area afterwards. I've been trying to map out the commute on google maps during various times but wanted to get a feel of how bad this will be? Highway 130 seems to only have one spot that gets a little backed up during rush hour, but man that $6.54 toll each way seems brutal. The alternative route seems to add 20min though so I don't really have a choice. 1hr and 7min seems to be the commute without traffic. Seems brutal.

Not seeing a lot of places I like, or they're pricier than I'd like.

Thinking of going towards Buda, or Manor, and wondering what shuttles routes are. I heard there's one from San Marcos and that I will learn more of this alleged shuttle at the orientation, but, I'd like to know earlier, to help decide the move.

The blue is the floodplain. About 30 acres of the greenbelt were bulldozed last week and 10 acres of it were cleared and built into houses last year. That whole stretch was a greenbelt full of forest and field, wherein I walked and foraged for years. The backyards of the houses in the new development are all 10,000 sq ft of manicured grass. 

They used to be bursting with dewberry patches, wild onion, wild oats, mesquites, prickly pear, sugarberries, maple, willow, paloverde, juniper, oak, sunflowers, and so much more. Now the earth is scalped to the bare dirt.

The houses are modern abominations, with Teslas and luxury cars parked out front. Probably only migrant tech workers are buying them, because the other side of the creek is classic old east Austin with half the home prices.

I'm sick of the indiscriminate clearing of nature in Austin, now even in floodplain greenbelts, which are the last refuge of nature in the area. What little remains is already being used for dumping grounds and homeless camps.

He ran a report and our house qualifies and he'll be coming back on Monday to go over everything. He said it's not a lease or contract and similar programs have been started in California. 

I'm planning on calling SunRun today to get more details on the program before he comes back. Of course, there's red flags ($0 and him knocking on my door). I'm using Rhythyn Energy so I may call them too.

I’d like to look into ‘Texas grid-proofing’ our house a bit.  Was always interested in doing a solar setup with batteries like the Tesla powerwall, but for cost reasons we might just look into something like a Generac that runs off our gas line.

I’m mainly wondering if anyone knows of a good company that can help us figure out what is best for our house and help us do the math and weigh the pros and cons. Is there a company in town like that that sells these things and does consultations?

I’m considering dancing the Solar Dance and would like to get y’all’s insight on local solar buyback plans. A lot of energy providers are re-vamping their plans to benefit us less and I was wondering if anyone has found one they’re satisfied with that is still currently allowing enrollment into that plan?

I’ve noticed most providers don’t know Jack about solar buyback, they’re just reading off a script that doesn’t clarify a thing. So, I’m coming to trusty Reddit to see if y’all had any luck. 

Really liked one that Chariot has but they aren’t enrolling for my area at the moment. 

I’d really like to see no expiration on rollover of bill credits and a payout of the balance when the plan ends. I know it’s a high ask these days.

The goal, always, is to allow people to exercise their freedom of speech and for everyone to get home safely at the end of the day. There will most likely be counter-protesters: ignore them and if they are live streaming and trying to force an ""interview"", playing very loud copyright music is a helpful deterrent. In this kind of setting, engaging in arguments trying to convince or reason with opposition is more likely to be a waste of energy and lead to increase in tensions so we kindly advise against it or at least be very aware of when to walk away from heated conversations.

1971p5c,The Auto Show is not worth going. Trust me.," I have gone to almost all the auto shows the last 10 years or more. This one was very lackluster. When you have to bring a bakery, and a sticker shop, and a gutter cover salesman, among other totally non-related salesmen to take up room. You know there is room to spare (and there was large empty areas, never seen that before). There were several auto makers that barely brought any cars to the show (mercedes benz, BMW, jaguar, land rover, and more). And the following did not even show up: 

Alfa Romeo, Acura, Buick, Cadillac, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Fisker, Genesis, Lexus, Lincoln, Lucid, Mazda, Mini, Polestar, Ram, Rivian, Tesla

In addition, certain vendors used to have large events and hype displays, and many had large screens. No screens anymore, minimal hype displays. And the Cherry on top? Certain car makers closed off many more of their cars than usual to sitting in, so I am window shopping from the outside. The whole point of the auto show is 2 fold. Many automakers at the same place, and I can sit and experience the new cars. Missed on both marks.

I say we stop paying and supporting the show, until it becomes decent again. It's a shell of what it used to be.

1drm510,Friendly notice - RMP discounts for EV drivers,"This is niche, (and Tesla owners probably won’t care given the ubiquitous Supercharger network) but if you own an EV and use public fast charging, Rocky Mountain Power has partnered with Electrify America and is rolling out 20 RMP branded charging sites (with all stations having 350KW chargers) across the state.

https://www.rockymountainpower.net/savings-energy-choices/electric-vehicles/find-charging-stations.html

The fantastic part is that they are only charging $0.27/kWh (peak) $0.22/kW (off hours) for RMP customers if you add their discount code to the EA app!  

This is excellent pricing for 350kW charging!  

They’ve opened a big station in Moab which was a black hole for non-Tesla owners. 

The IMPORTANT PART:

Follow the video (embedded in the link above) to get it set up.   BUT, the video is wrong where it shows entering just the main 8 digits of your account number.   You need to put in all 12 without hyphens or spaces. 

I went back and forth with RMP and EA and I finally got someone at RMP that knew the secret.  

Note: the discount is only available at the RMP locations, not all EA locations like Sam’s in So SLC.  But that site is a dumpster fire of ID.4s charging to 100% and Bolts hogging the 350kW chargers when they are only capable of under 100kW charging.)

Hey everyone! I could use some help with the order in which I should complete each of the following steps for my new car purchase. Thank you in advance for the help!

Here are the facts:

I am upgrading from my current car to a new Tesla Model Y. A coworker has already agreed to purchase my current car after I buy the Tesla. I have a pick-up scheduled for the Tesla this Tuesday. I have indicated with Tesla that I will be moving the license plate from my current car onto the Tesla (custom plate).

What do you all think should be the order of operations? Sell the car to my co-worker, take the plate off, and bring the plates to the Tesla dealership? Bring the car with the plates to the dealership, transfer the plate, and then sell the car without plates on it? Another combination?

ipiyju,Mad your solar panels don't keep your power on when there's an outage?,"Given how much insane sales pressure there is for people to get solar panels in Utah, and how disingenuous a lot of those sales folks are, I figure there's at least a handful of people who are mad they don't have backup power from their solar panels during a blackout because their installer didn't explain their system's limitations to them. This is why:

https://syonyk.blogspot.com/2018/05/why-typical-home-solar-setup-does-not-work-off-grid.html

TL;DR: Some solar systems can run off-grid but they cost twice as much. You need to add batteries (e.g. Tesla Powerwall) and most solar companies do a very basic grid-tied setup that needs to have grid power as the backbone. Works great until the power goes out. Some have a separate low power aux output for maybe a fridge and furnace fan, but not most. 

Now, if you find this unacceptable, there are a few things you could do, in increasing order of complexity and cost:

* Accept that power outages are fairly rare and that you don't have to solve every problem even if it seems like a huge deal right now
* Get a UPS for your modem, router, and a few power banks for phones
* Get a small generator, either gas or one of those GoalZero style solar 'generators' ($)
* Ask a trustworthy solar installer about changing your inverter to [one with a backup output](https://www.smainverted.com/tech-tip-installing-secure-power-supply/) ($$)
* Ask about adding batteries to your solar setup for full off-grid capability ($$$)",SaltLakeCity,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/ipiyju/mad_your_solar_panels_dont_keep_your_power_on/,9/9/2020 16:12,18,0,utah

We like to have huge parties with wine and cocktails and amazing food, so if there’s no excellent restaurants yet, we’ll have house parties and eventually open something. 

Hoping since this region is getting so many expats, maybe the culture will be shifting to more “classically liberal” in terms of culture? Just wanting to make sure we won’t be ostracized.

1ieozko,Uber Driver AHMAD Stealing,"I feel like being a super Chad right now lol

This has been my morning. I used Ubers to order Dennys. Had this driver pick up my food. Then I noticed he was driving all around and going the wrong way even though i ordered priority.  I call into tech support and they inform me he actually stole my food and canceled the pick up. So I guess he pretended like he didn't grab the food and canceled and then another driver went there but no food and the restaurant was like someone took it. Tech support confirmed by phoning the restaurant.  So they refunded me back and gave me ten dollar credit and told me that driver won't be allowed to pick up any orders for you and it's being investigated further 


So I wait 30 minutes and order from Tap and Barral . I'm not watching the app close enough and when I open it to see who picked up my order Ahmad the stealer was somehow allowed to pick up my order  and then guess what. He stole it. Then another driver went to grab it and it was already gone so I guess he canceled the pickup and they had another driver pick it up but nothing is there and I'm on the phone with tech support again. Pretty annoyed and wondering why he's allowed to pick up my order and they again reassure me he isn't allowed to do that.

Anyone have issues like this? I dealt with this for two hours. Got a 15 dollar credit ( granted fully refunded) i just think that's crap and they can do better.

Part of me goes... shouldn't I be making a report incase this guy is known to do this with the police? Maybe I'm thinking too into this.

What do you guys think. Happy you got refunded and received 15 dollars credit?

1e7m63l,Do drivers in Langley not know the rules of the road???,"A few hundred feet from my parking space I stopped at an intersection controlled by traffic lights. I was in the middle lane. To my immediate right was an empty lane that can go straight or turn right. To my immediate left is a left turning lane only. A van was in that lane. Once the light turned green, I moved forward. Dumbass to my left somehow felt he had the right to go straight, despite the fact the lane is clearly marked. He narrowly missed hitting me. 

A couple of intersections past that one there are three lanes. The far left lane is a turning lane, clearly marked. The middle lane is the only lane  going straight. The right lane is marked as a turning right lane only from quite far back before the intersection. So another dumbass completely ignores the signs and markings that the right lane he was in was for turning only. But he felt he was entitled to push his way into the middle lane. 

The above happened within a couple of minutes. 

But I’ve also witnessed several cars turning right at a controlled intersection that has a visible sign indicating a right turn canNOT be done on a red light. How freakin’ oblivious can people be???

I can quite honestly say I’ve never encountered so many shitty and entitled drivers as I have in the lower mainland. And very few seem to believe there’s an actual speed limit.

1jbonsb,So you think you want to light a Tesla on fire,"As a local FF, PLEASE do not light EVs on fire in protest. The type and quantity of gasses that results are, in many cases, very immediately and highly harmful to firefighters. Protocols are in place now to try and come off the truck with masks on but if a bystander doesn’t mention is an EV, there is still a risk that we treat it as a normal car fire and mask up once we’ve had a chance to see what we are up against.

It takes tons of water that is usually now harmfully contaminated and we have to try and evacuate local businesses and multi families or try and shut down their HVAC systems in order to keep the toxic gas from entering businesses. Once the fire is “out”, it now has to, often times, be tailed by an engine(keeping it out of service for other emergencies) to a yard where it’ll sit for a while before it’s potentially disposed of because it can continue to light off.

There is a lot more to this including our current lack of ability to properly clean our bunker gear of these chemicals, the damage caused by that intensity of fire to the surface below it, the amount of resources that may have to be dedicated to managing such an incident that leaves grandma who needs CPR receiving care with a delay because of it, etc etc

1cnmtck,YSK: More motorcyclists are filtering and splitting now because of the Tesla autopilot that killed a rider in Snohomish.,"This is just a PSA, not about the legalities of it, or if people should do it or not. This is just what's been going on in the WA motorcycling sphere.

A few weeks ago a motorcyclist was killed in Snohomish when rear ended by a Tesla that was on autopilot. The car made no attempts to stop and the driver was on his phone.

This has made A LOT of local riders here nervous because of the amount of Tesla cars in the State, and as a result many of them are filtering and splitting for the first time, or will be breaking lane sharing rules more and more. 

Again this isn't about whether or not they SHOULD or SHOULD NOT do it, this is just letting you know that if you see motorcycles splitting and filtering more often this summer and going forward, this is why and just keep an eye out.

This incident with the Tesla has pissed off and scared a lot of riders, and honestly can you blame them? Elon's bitch ass wont fix these stupid cars and refuses to field proper recognition for bikes, I don't blame them for taking their safety into their own hands. 

There will be a lot of riders who are filtering or splitting for the first time in these next few months as it warms up. Be careful, and know these riders are trying to be cautious and careful themselves. 

I know this post will get mega downvoted, but again this is just a PSA about what's going on.",Seattle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1cnmtck/ysk_more_motorcyclists_are_filtering_and/,5/9/2024 2:46,1162,420,washington

1h3svck,Elderly people should not be driving,"
This story hits far too close to home. Earlier today in Bellevue, at a small restaurant furnished with heavy wood and iron tables, an elderly driver in a Tesla accidentally pressed the gas pedal instead of reverse. The car surged past a metal pole and crashed into the building. The aftermath was horrifying—several people were injured, including one person who was pinned under the car and suffered broken legs. Just next door, there was a kids’ art studio. Had the car gone slightly farther, the consequences could have been even more tragic.

This incident underscores a critical issue: older drivers should be retested to ensure they can drive safely. Reflexes, vision, and mental clarity often decline with age, increasing the likelihood of accidents like this. This is not about age discrimination—it’s about preventing avoidable tragedies and protecting everyone on the road.

I lost a dear friend this year because of a similar incident. An elderly woman, on her way to get ice cream, struck my friend with her car. She didn’t even notice and made a full turn before stopping.

Does anyone know how to push this issue to lawmakers? It’s time to start a serious conversation about implementing regular testing for senior drivers to ensure they remain capable of operating vehicles responsibly. Lives depend on it.

Emergency declarations are controversial, as they often give the executive branch more power and allows for bypassing other branches of government. Trump's National Energy Emergency directly seeks to find ways to bypass environmental legislations.

As we know, Washington is beautiful because of our protected public land and water, and Trump wants to use emergency power to bypass these laws. He wants to open up more public land and coastline for oil and gas drilling, as well as LNG export (the Port of Tacoma has an LNG export station). National gas pipelines like the GTN Xpress are expanding in the state, despite Inslee's opposition. It is likely that companies will try to build more pipelines and drill under Trump.

So, write to your congressional representative to oppose this power grab. Emergency powers should be rigorously justified, not just declared at will. Letting Trump get away with this is how we get to facism (more so than Elon's salute IMO).

Edit: Ofc we can do both. But actions speak louder than words, and most actions I see on this subreddit and across social media have been about Musk, not Trumps orders. It seems like Elon's actions are prioritized in people's attention way more than Trump's actual orders.",Seattle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1i7776c/can_we_move_on_from_elons_salute_and_focus_on/,1/22/2025 9:14,2477,309,washington

1jgd11w,regarding tesla :(,"I looked through this subreddit because I heard there were people destroying other people’s private property and almost bragging about it.

Is this kind of behavior acceptable in seattle? I’m not from Seattle, so I’m not going to criticize y’all, but I’ve constantly seen people almost advocating for destroying others’ public property, and it seems like more people than not are on board with it. People try to put anti-elon patches on their cars just so that they don’t get set on fire when they park it to go to the deli. 😭

I guess I’m just confused about how this is seen as right. They can’t buy a car without it getting wrecked, graffitied, or set on fire?!

Also, how is this going to further your political views? I really doubt that no matter your political opinions, the general population in the middle of politics is going to go vote for whoever or whatever these people (the ones destroying/graffiti-ing the cars) are going to vote for.

This also isn’t a political statement, as I claim no side. However, can we stop the graffiti-ing of people’s cars and/or setting them on fire?",Seattle,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1jgd11w/regarding_tesla/,3/21/2025 9:42,0,38,washington
1jk300f,"Question? Tesla protests are good, but anyone know of a planed protests at the local Seattle ICE office or Boarder Patrol?","Everyone seems to be focused on DOGE and the dismantling of the federal government agencies but for me the scarier crisis is the deportation to a foreign prison without due process, many of who came here through legal channels for legitimate asylum claims. Not to mention they he multiple Green-card holders who have been rounded up and face deportation. 

The Trump administration has refused to give details on the 200 plus sent to El Salvador and has repeatedly said they are rapist and murders but information found by journalists disputes those claims. 

We just over two months in, and we are already dehumanizing people, and sending them to foreign work camps without trial or due process. If people don’t wake up and push back, how long before they start sending US citizens? 

No one is safe if the administration can just ignore due process rights and the courts. 

^(I really don’t want to hear about how democrats politicians are not doing enough when they literally have very little to no power. Right now activists have more power make change, than the Democratic Party does. We cant wait for 2027 when they possibly do have the power, by then it will be too late at this rate. )

13wyhkv,"Visited Seattle for a week, and discovered that it's my favorite city in the US.","So I just got back from my first time visiting Seattle- and holy shite. No wonder why a lot of you guys gatekeep and instill fear in outsiders- Seattle's perfect! In the first 24hrs, I found myself tearing up at how beautiful and seemingly utopian it felt. I've honestly never felt more at home.

Coming from LA (but lived all over the US), it seems like every complaint here is 100x worse in LA (and probably other cities). My overall takeaway is that because the city is so left-leaning, the people are actually reasonably taken care of. Obviously, every city has its flaws, but having spent time in most major US cities- Seattle takes the cake.

That being said, I'd like to note that we spent most of our time in North, West, and DT Seattle. So I'm aware that these observations change depending on the area. Obviously, these are huge generalizations. But this is what I observed as an outsider, coming from overrated LA:

* It is LUSH. Green. And fucking clean. Even when the skies were gray, like the early misty mornings, everything seemed to thrive. The plants and wildlife seemed to coexist in such a wonderful way with the city. It was wild entering full on forests in the middle of the city.  I couldn't believe that such epic hikes were within an hour of the city center.
* People are respectful and mindful of each other. You can see it in the quality of service and friendliness of almost everyone you encountered. It seemed like people were willing to connect and share stories or even humor. This lead to a trickle-down effect to even pedestrians and bikers. It was eye-opening being in a place that's genuinely inclusive towards everyone. Not feeling judged or threatened by anyone.
* Cost-of-living is high, but not as high as LA, NY, San Fran, etc. You get a better bang for your buck compared to other major cities.
* Weed is wayyyy danker and better value than Cali. However, I'd like to note that I only smoke bunk bottom shelf value deals.
* The homeless situation is barely a crisis. It’s probably, what, 5% of the LA problem. You barely saw them in residential areas. In DT of course there were more there. But if you did see them, they kept to themselves. There weren't many tents and hardly any encampments. I even saw a building dedicated to providing showers for the homeless. Low-income housing seemed like something encouraged as opposed to shunned. In LA, in ANY neighborhood, you'll find homeless encampments that essentially shut down residential streets. Meanwhile, their neighbors are multi-million dollar mansions. I know it's probably shocking to you locals. But visit LA and you'll realize how bad things actually get with people outright driving around them with their teslas.
* Huge outdoor recreation scene. Have never seen more joggers or bikers in my life. I died laughing when I found out that pickleball is the state sport. I effing love it.
* People don’t really dress up. Even on a weekend night in Ballard, almost half of the people going out will look like they just got back from a hike or recreation activity.
* Drivers wholeheartedly shared the road. Making sure to stop at any used crosswalk. I felt like a huge asshole when I'd naturally try J-walking. Bike lanes were everywhere and many were split with its own median. The road layouts took some getting used to. Lots of last-minute lane changes. One-way streets and endless roundabouts. The lack of stop signs in certain residential areas made it seem pretty dangerous. However, it ended up being the perfect passive way to slow people down and be mindful of each other.
* Honks were rarely heard. Almost everyone was easygoing with others on the road. On occasion, there was someone in a rush. But other than that- it was INSANE how calm it was to drive there. None of that LA madness and selfish drivers. It made us realize how horrible LA drivers are and how selfish they can actually be.
* Bars and pubs were lively, fun and engaging. It wasn’t tables of dressed-up people, taking selfies, and then immediately going back to scrolling on Instagram. It was real conversation. It was smiles and laughter.
* Doggo city. A lot of big, happy and fluffy pups. It made me so happy to see them live their best life in an outdoorsy and active city.
* You guys actually read. Other than London, I’ve never seen so many people with a book in hand. Reading at parks, cafes, breweries, bus- you name it there’s a reader there.
* Music scene is thriving and happening. A plethora of small and big venues which support their local artists/musicians.
* The idea of a extremely lefty city seemed daunting (for some reason I drew this conclusion from online sources). But oh boy, all it means is that the city actually takes care of the people. And they actually get shit done. Things make sense here.
* Barely saw any cops- yet everything was very safe. I felt comfortable walking/biking everywhere. The only drug I witnessed was pot.
* Today I learned: that there are no billboards on the freeways of Seattle. Nothing to obstruct those beautiful skies!
* Food food food. It was freaking awesome seeing so many little restaurants in each micro neighborhood. The ingredients always seemed to be highly sourced with the service being spectacular. But honestly, for the price, LA actually might take the lead on this one. I didn't even realize that I could be considered a ""foodie"" *BUT, HUGE BUT OVER HERE,* this is because I’ve found my “go-to” places for each cuisine accumulated over years of trial and error. In Seattle, the food was always solidly good but not mind blowing. In LA, it’s either amazing or food poisoning. That being said, change my mind! *Please send me your food reccs. I’m a huge Notion nerd and have a whole Seattle section in case anyone is interested in sharing info.*

So that's about it! Officially moving in Spring of next year. I don't even care if you're going to downvote me. I LOVE YOUR CITY, CHEERS\~

\*\* And yes, I know that the winters are not easy in Seattle! Will be returning in November to solidify the decision. But as horrible as the weather may be, I personally would be incredibly grateful to have seasons and greenery again.

On the months leading up to this trip, they often said ""Why Seattle? What's in Seattle?"" Now I'm excited to say, ""meh, it was alright"", and keep this slice of heaven to ourselves ;)

Also genuinely concerned that I may have blown ""the spot"". So might take this post down later  lol. \*\*

**UPDATE SINCE THIS POST:** Due to work, my partner and I will be moving to the UK now- that rainy weather will be following us and I'll forever miss the opportunity of living in Seattle. On the brighter side, I've convinced my parents and brother to move to Seattle. Whom I'll visit often and be able to explore their city via their new chapter.

I’m currently using Safeco as my Tesla insurance. I need to do a repair due to accident in garage, but things really get tricky after couple weeks research:

So I went ahead and contacted 4 certified body shop in Seattle area - one not work with Safeco, one directly told me that they can’t get SafeCo approve their rate, so I need to pay extra cost, one needs to wait Feb for just estimate, the other one can start very soon but they will not wait for insurance approval post 5 business day after supplement submitted to insurance, I need to pay the extra cost first and reimburse later

Insurance said they can’t commit to cover all the cost, but they also don’t provide any in-network shop which can repair. Any suggestion? I also have legal service, should I go to the last one and just try to reimburse later?

And I know they're not all actually student drivers, because I look over at them and they're all older people like moms, business men in Teslas, etc. Unless they've lived under a rock, they're not learning to drive. And I've seen a lot of them blatantly break the law, run red lights, turn on no turn on red lights, blow stop signs. 

Like what's up with that? Is it some political statement, was there some dumb law that got passed that exempts student drivers, do student drivers get some toll road exemption, is it some traffic camera hack that traffic cameras won't ticket student drivers, is it some kind of subtle hidden calling card like how swingers hand upside down pineapples on their door?

Because come on, if it's not anything practical like that they can't think anyone's buying the lie that they're a student driver right? And even if they're a student driver, it would mean the student driver's driving cautiously not driving like an asshole, right? Like they all can't think we're all that dumb right?

Like I'd forgive a student driver for driving slow or being overly cautious, but I don't care if it's a student driver or not, if they speed past me, cut me off, pass me dangerously, or do any other kind of stupid shit I'm not giving them any breaks, and from my understanding neither would a cop. 

Someone explain this to me, it's killing me now. I've lived in several cities and never seen so many before.

1ixkxrb,Thank you Governor,"I emailed Governor Bob Ferguson regarding the SAVE act and here is the response I received. As a woman and parent of a trans teenager I'm so grateful to live in a state that protects all of its  residents and stands up to bullshit like this. 

Message from Governor Bob Ferguson:

The transgender community is under attack right now, including their ability to access health care.

As you know, if an individual’s sex assigned at birth is incongruent with their innate gender identity, this can cause varying degrees of gender dysphoria, a serious medical condition. That's not a political opinion – that's a medical fact.

Health care provided to treat gender dysphoria is just that – it’s health care. In Washington state, we will not treat health care like a political football.

Because Washington's health care laws will be informed by health care professionals, we will continue protecting health care for transgender individuals.

Health care is a human right – and a civil right. In Washington state, we will respect that.

Attorney General Nick Brown filed a lawsuit against President Trump's executive order that threatens to end federal funding to medical institutions providing gender-affirming care. My team is working closely with the Attorney General to ensure Washingtonians are protected from illegal federal actions. 

We're also being proactive to get real results for all Washingtonians from our state government. I was proud to announce the Department of Health will now process all requests to change gender designation on birth certificates within three business days. Previously, there was as much as a 10 month wait. A team of more than a dozen people worked through a weekend to clear the department’s backlog of more than 500 requests.

We have the experience from President Trump's first administration to fight these battles. With support and advocacy from transgender individuals in Washington, we stood up to President Trump's ban on transgender individuals in the military, we supported health care access for transgender veterans, and we led 17 states in upholding the right of Gavin Grimm, a transgender student, to use the bathroom corresponding with his identity. 

We picked our battles. We were methodical. We repeatedly stood up for the rights of Washingtonians. As Governor, I have the same approach.

President Trump's chaos will not stop us from working on behalf of the people. We will continue to do our job and serve the everyday needs of Washingtonians while we are protecting Washingtonians from any cruel and unconstitutional actions.

We're going to continue fighting to ensure that every Washingtonian, regardless of where they live, whom they love, what they believe, how they identify, where they work, or where they were born has access to quality education and skills-training, health care, safe communities, clean air and water and safe work environments.

We will keep fighting to make our state safer, government more efficient, ferries more reliable and our state more affordable for families.

We're going to keep moving forward. We're not going to change our values. In fact, we are going to lean into them. That is how we're going to deal with this. That's how we're going to be successful as a state.

We've been through this before, and we came through thanks to a lot of hardworking people working very hard. We’re going to do it again.

Sincerely,

Constituent Services

From what I understand, these cables have just a few dollars worth of scrap copper in them, but cost thousands to replace - so a lot of the charging companies have just stopped replacing them. Is it maybe just vandalism?

It's creating a charging island where EV owners are forced to travel long distances just to use their vehicles. Especially in Seattle where many people can't charge at their residence, this is a problem. 

Is there anything that can be done about this? Seems like the police aren't really doing anything about it.

This text below is taken from another thread from a post I shared.  I feel it is a sentiment of lots of Seattle Elites that we are not to be treated with equality because we don’t have their real careers.  



“Anyways, waiting tables has never been a middle class career.  Or a career at all really.  Most people just do it as a means to get by while hoping to make it as an artist or to get through college or whatever.  Raising a family on a retail or food service wage is not something that has ever been a path to success.  It isn't supposed to be.  These are unskilled entry level jobs to get you bootstrapped into a real career, or to live in shared housing forever, not middle class.”

1jbhtd5,Tesla owner who is concerned about teslas being set on fire,"You all saw the news about a tesla set on fire in Capitol Hill. What is concerning is people condoning this, mostly on the other subreddit.
Tesla owners are not the enemy, in fact most of them are on the left. 
Question for other tesla owners specifically,  what do you think? Any precautions you are taking in this current political climate?

“In society we do horrible things to one another. We don’t see the people it affects, we don’t see their face, we don’t see them as people”

General advice
- comprehensive insurance, sentry mode, be vigilant, and gap insurance if you are financing your tesla car in current political situation

Results from talking with few people on here
after spending some time over last few days. Thank you for your time for the banter. Appreciate it

- General consensus: it is ok to damage/vandalize tesla cars, intimidate tesla owners for the greater good. I hope it is not general consensus in real life and just on reddit. 
- sell the car. These people I assume either are kids/teenagers or do not have a clue how finances work
-  it’s a lemon. Probably never actually drove a cybertruck
- it’s ugly. Subjective. I love the way my car looks and bought it for myself.
- owning a tesla is supporting Nazis : don’t know the difference between someone acting like a nazi and literal Nazis from 1930s Germany 
Personal Attacks - I tried to be respectful. For people making personal attacks on me, you already lost the debate 
I am saddened by fellow Americans who think it’s ok to destroy personal property. I sincerely hope it is only mob thinking on Reddit and doesn’t reflect the good people of Seattle

""The Tesla had gone through a fence, struck three large trees, and was on fire. The deputy broke out the driver’s door window, but a large adult male was unresponsive.""

>... Firefighters quickly extinguished the blaze, but due to the Tesla's lithium-ion batteries, the fire department said the risk of reignition remains.

>A fire engine accompanied the Tesla as it was towed to a wrecking yard, where it will be stored away from other vehicles for several weeks to ensure it does not ignite again.

>Authorities remind the public to store all lithium battery-powered items, such as toys, vapes, and scooters, outside and away from combustible materials.

Enter Amy Walen, Democratic Representative from Kirkland. Amy and her husband own 2 car dealerships in Seattle. Amy also is the chair of the House Consumer Protection & Business Committee.

A bipartisan bill looked to allow electric vehicle manufacturers sell cars directly to consumers, the way Tesla does. Tesla has been carved out to allow this for over a decade now, but ever since efforts to allow others have been shot down.

Dealerships have fought this on the basis that it would “kill their sales and hurt their connection with the community”.

My question is, if dealerships are better for “consumer protection”, then why would this kill their sales? Surely consumers would want to go to dealers for the better pricing and lovely experience?

This is government corruption, plain and simple. 


- How much did your dealerships make selling electric vehicles?

11tvlep,"TIL that WA State protects auto dealers and treats Tesla special, making it very hard for new EV companies to sell cars in WA.","I was talking to a person recently who works for a new-ish EV car company. I asked why I don't seem to see as many here as I do when I travel. He said it's because WA laws prohibit selling cars in WA unless you use a franchised dealer middleman. Their customers have to go to Idaho or Oregon to pick up their cars, and they are highly limited from servicing them in WA.

This was surprising given this is famously exactly how Tesla sells cars, and they sell direct to consumer in WA, have lots of service centers, and there are Teslas EVERYWHERE.

Turns out the history here is that WA did not require dealers by law in the past. But when Tesla started to become successful in the early 2010's, a bunch of ""small business owners"" that are in WA's State Senate introduced and passed a bill changing the law to prohibit direct to customer sales of motor vehicles. You know, to protect the customer.

Except Tesla. They grandfathered Tesla.

So now, in 2023, Tesla, the most valuable carmaker in the world by 5X, gets special treatment by WA, while any new competitor such as Rivian, Luicid, VinFast, Faraday, Lordstown, etc... They all have to work through dealers, or not sell in the state. Despite WA having the 2nd higest per capita EV sales in the nation. 

Of course, they tried to change this, but HB1388 died in session in 2021.

I would use this car only for hiking/backpacking on the weekends so I'm wondering if the extra two inches of ground clearance will actually make a difference or not. I have driven on the very pothole-y roads for hikes but we've mostly used AWD SUVs for those trips. 

For those of you who own a Tesla, have you skipped out/turned back on any hikes because of the potholes you've encountered? My points of reference would be the drive up to Colchuck Lake trailhead and the trailhead for Hidden Lakes Lakeout (which we somehow managed on a rental sedan).

1che2k3,"WA DOL using inflated vehicle MSRP for RTA Tax, would you try to contest?","Hello,

I recently received the bill for vehicle tabs from WA DOL and one particular entry on that really got me interested.

I bought my car 2023 Tesla Model Y, and the sale price was $50,990. The current price of the car is 49,990 on Tesla website. In the bill that WA DOL sent to me, they are charging me $690, which means they are using an MSRP of $627,27.

If I use my own vehicle purchase price in 2023, it should be $561. If they use the current market price, then the RTA tax should be $550. (I am going to ignore the fact that similar cars are available for 35k in the market).

Here is the explanation of how they value vehicles and the calculations. [https://dol.wa.gov/vehicles-and-boats/taxes-fuel-tax-and-other-fees/regional-transit-authority-rta-tax](https://dol.wa.gov/vehicles-and-boats/taxes-fuel-tax-and-other-fees/regional-transit-authority-rta-tax)

I feel like DOL is being sneaky, and trying to use inflated valuation to charge as much as possible. I am sure I am not the only one. Have any of you contested this with DOL? Is it worth trying?

Thanks in advance for reading my post, and appreciate your response if you decide to leave any.

Edit: Here is a copy of the bill. [https://imgur.com/a/eojqiO8](https://imgur.com/a/eojqiO8)

Also, I called the 360-902-3770 number that was on the bill. The customer care rep told me that they will send a request to Tesla for the updated vehicle MSRP and I would receive an update in 7-10 days. Fingers crossed.

Update: I received an email from one of the DOL officers, and he asked me to send in documentation from Tesla showing purchase price details. Two weeks after sending the documents I logged in to my account on DOL website and I saw that the RTA tax amount had been reduced to the correct amount. Thanks for all the responses, and hope this was helpful.

One was a regular 4-door sedan. The other was an EV (Model Y). 

Sedan fee: $143.

Model Y renewal fee: $903!!!

Assuming an average (at home - so cheapest possible) electric rate of around $0.13/kWh, and assuming an average (highway) efficiency of 330Wh/mi, and separately assuming gas prices of $5.30/gal and a highway efficiency of 30MPG for the sedan, I would need to drive 5700 miles per year just to break even on electric vs. gas in this city. And that's in a historically *high* gas price era with relatively cheap hydroelectric power.

That's around 16 miles per day, or around 23 miles per day if only driving on workdays. I *might* put that much driving in over the course of a year, but in 2 years I've only put 8000 miles on the vehicle - nowhere close to 5700 per year.

14pc9j2,Tesla Superchargers at Meijer in Greenfield,"I did a little bit of shopping at the Meijer store at Layton Ave. and 60th St. this past Friday.  When I was walking back to my car, I noticed that the area of the parking lot behind the gas station was fenced in and that several Tesla superchargers were in the process of being unboxed and set up.

I don't own a Tesla (or any EV, for that matter) but it seems like this would be a good location for these superchargers, particularly for those who drive between Chicagoland and southern Wisconsin.

hkkx36,Tesla (Electric) Charging in Madison,"I have seen a few of these posts but most of them are outdated at this point (broken links, etc)

I'm moving to Madison soon and want to know about the option for charging EVs especially a Tesla. I have three questions about Madison EV friendliness. 

1. Chargers around town

I see that their are two chargers in North Madison one at the mall and one in a parking lot (on Washington Ave) - I assume these are free parking lots.

And then there are a few  downtown (where I want to live), but they all seem to be inside of parking garages (that I would need to pay to charge + pay to park)? 

Work does not have any charging stations, what it the likelihood that I can just live off of charging stations around town? I don't mind going out of my way once a week to sit around while the vehicle charges. 

2. Apartments with chargers

Ideally I would like to live in an Apartment building that has an EV charging station, but it seems that all of the apartments that offer it are pretty high end. They all seem to be luxury rentals with prices starting at 1.3k/month + parking fees (\~150/month). I don't need all the fancy amenities (like a fitness area), but would like some place to charge while home. Did anyone have any luck with an apartment parking garage that has outlets that the Landlord is cool with you using.  Of course I would be willing to pay for any electricity fees I consume. 

3. Anything else I should have a heads up about? 

I plan on getting Model 3 Long Range (standard wheels) and may need to switch out the wheel to [these](https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-3-18_-aero-wheel-and-winter-tire-package), but then I would need to go to a service station to do that I presume.",madisonwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/hkkx36/tesla_electric_charging_in_madison/,7/3/2020 15:21,0,18,wisconsin

1clv6gh,Referendum while buying new trucks?,"This is kind of a rant so sorry in advance. I have to say I am not interested in voting for more taxes in Madison when the city is buying the ""brass"" of the Madison PD all brand new Chevy tahoes to drive. I know that this is probably a small chunk of the budget overall. It just shows the waste that has started seeping in. It doesn't feel like the mayor has any intention of balancing the budget. I love Madison. I'm okay paying a little more in taxes to keep the city looking great and running smoothly. I believe city employees deserve fair wages and need raises yearly to keep talent. I've even seen the value in the rapid bus line. But just wasting money on $60k+ SUVs that are only driven to and from the office for officers that then sit all day in front of city hall in meter spots that usually earn revenue for the city is a major red flag for myself. There isn't even an attempt to rein in the budget from what the mayor has shown. I for one will be voting against any referendum the city puts forth this year until some adulting is shown from city hall.

12umltw,Opinions on purchasing an EV,"I am going to be moving to the Madison area soon, and it is likely I will need to purchase a car pretty soon after making the move. I’m considering the idea of purchasing an electric vehicle, but I have been warned not to do so by a few people. For those who own EVs in the Madison area (or anyone who knows a lot about cars), how do you like owning one/would you recommend it? If so, why, and what models would you suggest I take a look at? If not, what has made it annoying/disadvantageous to own an EV in Madison? 

For context, I am from the southeast and not used to harsher winters. I have done a small bit of research, and it seems like one of the major drawbacks to electric vehicles is the amount of range they lose in colder weather (which coupled with charge times can become annoying). I plan on really only using whatever car I purchase for commuting/errands, not a ton of longer drives or road-trips.

1gasb9b,LA County supervisors take position opposing Proposition 36,"LA Co. services will be cut if Prop 36 is passed because it would repeal Prop 47. Per the article:

“Some of the programs supported through Prop 47 funding are Reentry Intensive Case Management Services, Skills and Experience for the Careers of Wednesday, Los Angeles Diversion, Outreach and programs in the city of Los Angeles, according to the motion. […]”

Which, yikes.

And I wanted to add to that concern by going a little deeper:

In CA, we have the awesome right (w certain limitations) to make our own laws.

We hate the smash and grabs, right? They look scary AF, and they’re not abt necessity. Ok. Penal Code 490.4 (organized retail theft aka shoplifting w friends or for profit) allows for those to be punished as a felony. So does Penal Code 459 (commercial burg). And 487 (grand theft). And 594 (vandalism). And 211 (robbery) if things go real sideways. I can tell you rn: felony filings for these cases have increased dramatically in the past year.

I live in CA. I work in CA. I pay taxes in CA.
I also work with the people most likely to be targeted by this potential legislation. And the prosecutors that’ll be enforcing it.

PROP 36, “The Homelessness, Drug Addiction, and Theft Reduction Act,” WILL NOT DO ANY OF THOSE THINGS. Not in the long term (or mid term or likely short term). Not in any sustainable way. Not without a HUGE waste of government resources that would be far better utilized at addressing the root cause of these problems through SERVICES/specialty courts.

Prop 36 undoes Prop 47 (“Criminal Sentences. Misdemeanor Penalties. Initiative Statute”) Prop 47 basically says, okay, if the amount in question in a theft is under $950, it’s a misdemeanor. This makes sense. Because it means that stealing or attempting to steal something worth $0.01-$949 is a misdemeanor. Prop 47 also removed repeat violations = auto felony. (BUT IT DID NOT REMOVE Pen Code 666 petty theft with prior that makes it a felony w up to 3 years prison if a person has 3+ theft priors/666.5 up to 4 years prison if auto related).

REMEMBER, this determination re: value of loss is not made before receipts are filed/etc. Which means a person can just say yeah it’s a lot of money idk how much if I had to guess over a thousand (and it’s really actually $200 after receipts come back) and it can be filed as a felony. So if it’s a shoplifting, and the store is like idk what they took but it was like at least three pairs of pants from a place where most pants are $200 and it can be filed as a felony.

WITH PROP 36: LOL. Numbers don’t matter at all!

If you have TWO (2) prior convictions for ANY theft REGARDLESS OF AMOUNT = felony.

Took your parent’s credit card to buy something online and shoplifted a beer? Lol, now you’re eligible for a felony.

Poor as fuck and shoplifting to eat? Twice before? How dare you. Felony! (I have had a real case for shoplifting a soda - my client was asked to pay < $3 in restitution and plead to a misdemeanor 484 petty theft. That is real).

The theft portions are going to CLOG up our system and result in SO MANY MORE PEOPLE having felony convictions and spending time in jail. More people in jail + overcrowded jails = THEYRE STILL GETTING BOUNCED OUT OF CUSTODY. Who do you want in custody more? Shoplifters or people with gun charges or assault charges or stalking charges? Hopefully, your answer is yeah I want the people that are a danger to people more than the people that are a danger to property in custody. So there isn’t going to be “greater punishment.” The custody time will be the same or less. It’s just gonna make it way easier for someone to get a felony on their record.

And guess what? It’s like, harder to do things like rent an apartment, get services, get scholarships for college(!), and get a job with a felony on your record. Even harder to get placed in some treatment programs.

AND THATS NOT EVEN ADDRESSING THE DRUGS OF IT ALL.

The text of the proposition makes me sick and embarrassed. “Other states have stricter drug laws, and their homelessness isn’t as bad.” Baby, one of the reason why there are fewer homeless people in Illinois and New Jersey is because it’s fucking cold. People die when they’re outside in the cold. If people that are homeless need to rely on others and services for their subsistence, where is the best place to put services to maximize the number of people to reach. Why, I don’t believe it’s in the suburbs, either. Population density matters when discussing homelessness. It’s just not nearly as feasible to be homeless in a Maryland suburb as it is in Baltimore.

That aside, this is what the law says:
2 previous drug convictions? Third one can be your felony!
Repeat what I said above abt the effect of a felony on the COURSE OF SOMEONE’S LIFE.

They make it cute, call it a “treatment mandated felony.” So if you complete the treatment, no more felony.

Addiction is NOT that simple. It’s a journey, it’s a struggle. We’re not talking about “no more giving people high fives.” We’re talking abt getting people who have brains that have been chemically changed and may have PHYSICAL effects from the drug use to completely reverse course in an instant, maintain that course, and never regress or else they get a felony.

And what’s worse: there’s no time limit for when these prior drug convictions occurred. Or if the drug is now legal. Possession to sell marijuana from 1996 & 1998, but now you’re addicted to meth AND ARE MERELY POSSESSING? Now, that possession charge can be a felony. State prison baby!

Listen, I love sugar. If someone told me no more sweets and I had to stay in a sweetless center or else I’d get a felony, idk how long I’d make it. Plus, I used to have an actual drug problem! And I can sure as shit tell you I would have a lot harder of a time if I was still in that state and sugar was replaced with alcohol, weed, or percs. (I’ve been sober from opiates since 2016, alcohol since 2021, weed since 2022). 

And then possession for sale. No surprise that many people with addictions also sell drugs to support addictions. Go figure! Now, Prop 36 says that we’re gonna let you know that if you sell drugs and someone dies from those drugs YOU CAN BE CHARGED WITH MURDER. 187. HOMICIDE.

Think abt this for a second. This means that if you sell someone drugs, and they use your drugs and some other drugs, and they OD, you can be charged with murder. Or they die of a heart attack bc they took too much. Murder.

But wait, wasn’t this about homelessness reduction? Isn’t that the first word of the Act?

Good question! It’s not!

Sure, homelessness is mentioned. If you get a “treatment-mandated felony,” they’re gonna set you up with shelters and job training and everything you need to fight homelessness and drug addiction. That’s the plan. How? Well, no details. But that’s the plan. Oh, and the person will be getting these services thru Medí-Cal or Medicaid. Don’t qualify? Too bad!

Mental health, what abt that? We know that there is a high rate of comorbidity between substance use disorder and mental health issues for sure. Well, you have two prior drug possessions (Health + Safety 11377), and now, we can charge you with that treatment mandatory felony. As part of that, AFTER YOU PLEAD NOT GUILTY, we’re gonna MAKE you speak to a “drug addiction expert” (who? what qualifications? Who cares!) that will conduct a “substance use and mental health evaluation” AND REPORT IT TO THE COURT. And if an individual chooses to participate in the interview, THOSE STATEMENTS CAN BE USED AGAINST THEM AT TRIAL. 

Truly, WHY would someone participate in this interview KNOWING that, if they aren’t accepted to treatment for any reason, they can have what they said in this evaluation used to CONVICT THEM OF A FELONY. 

There’s other stuff jammed into Prop 36 too:

A 3 year state prison enhancement if great bodily injury results from the attempt or commission of (what appears to be) any felony. There doesn’t appear to be a mental state attached to this (like intentionally or recklessly etc), so great, it’s extremely broad. Make that 5 years if the person is over 70. And up to 5 if it’s DV.

Receiving stolen property (496) if the property is valued at > $50k — a prison sentence enhancement. Applies even if the property is recovered. Applies even if it’s an attempted receiving stolen property. [Buying a car can be receiving stolen property if a person knew the vehicle was stolen. What is knew? Well, if you got it for cheap. I’ve seen 496 charged for buying without getting the title. So you think you’re buying a Tesla cybertruck at a discount bc the car sucks, so you pay 35k, they could charge you with a felony bc you should have known it was stolen at that price, charge you with a felony, and add a 1 yr enhancement bc technically the car is valued at > $50k.]

More shoplifting with friends penalties. Adding an enhancement of a CONSECUTIVE term of up to three years in prison if you + 2 or more friends “take” or “attempt to take” or “damage” or “attempt to damage” property in the course of a felony.

OH WELL THE LAWMAKERS CAN ALWAYS ROLL BACK SOME OF PROP 36 AFTER ITS ENACTED.

Oh, really?

Prop 36, as enacted, can only be changed by amendment or new statute passed with 2/3 votes of BOTH houses of the CA legislature. 

OR by another Proposition. Which means this is our only chance to stop it.

Already, corporate interests and retailers pushed to pass Pen Code s. 490.8, authorizing CRIMINAL PROTECTIVE ORDERS for stores to seek in cases of shoplifting, vandalizing, etc. Tagging the side of a Target can now be the basis for a court order making it CRIMINAL to enter the PARKING LOT of any Target. Corporations can already seek civil restraining orders, but that requires filling out a whole form and going to a hearing! Now, they don’t need to do anything but report a theft, and the prosecutors will do the rest. This is already unduly punitive and will result in steep increases in jail populations. But now, at least police may have less than 30 available units able to show up at the scene of a potential misdemeanor. This is the government actively ACTIVELY acting as the arm for large corporate interests. Is this gonna reduce crime? Hell no! But at least a big corporation will no longer need to spend its resources to determine if an individual’s action actually merits banning them from their stores.

The people of California have a chance now to mitigate the overprosecution of petty offenses and gross waste of government resources.

This Proposition does none of the things it claims to do. It’s just way to throw people in jail for being homeless bc we don’t like being forced to confront their existence. It’s not lenient drug laws that created homelessness. It’s all of the little things that we’ve prioritized over our fellow people.

Yeah, it sucks to see tent cities or to see people talking to themselves on the street. It sucks to see people doing drugs in the open. It sucks to acknowledge that those, too, are people that had a childhood and have lived whole lives that led them to the place they were when you saw them.

Prop 36 isn’t going to be the solution to homelessness or your discomfort. It’s just gonna further clog the courts, strain already strained systems, and make things worse.

Prop 36 doesn’t have a plan. It just has provisions for punishment.

1j0lsly,Department of Homeland Security agent in an apparent minor crash in Pasadena,"A bit before 1:00pm today, a Department of Homeland Security agent appears to have collided with another vehicle on Union near Fair Oaks in Old Town Pasadena. The DHS agent was in an unmarked, black Mustang vehicle with Arizona plates. There was a scratch on the left side of the front fender of the DHS vehicle. The agent had a DHS badge and was wearing a black polo shirt with the DHS logo on it. The other vehicle in the crash was the light brown SUV, which belongs to a Latino family with young children. The Pasadena Police officer was heard saying to the DHS agent, ""Can you tell me what happened?"" and ""I know you are here today."" Additional details and circumstances of the crash and the presence of DHS in Pasadena are unclear.

Just got back from the LA Auto Show and watched/experienced the horrendous organizing of CTs parked for test drives. There are two test drive locations. Tesla, Volvo, Polestar, Subaru and Stellantis share a drive-in location. Tesla makes its vehicles reverse “in” to a spot instead of stacking them in 2 straight lanes, the way every other automaker at both test drive locations did. Even the Ram trucks at Stellantis were parked nicely and off to the side. As a result, Tesla managed to create their own traffic jam down a private road and at some points jamming the public street. None of the Tesla test drive participants were particularly paying attention to parking the cars at the end of their drive, ironically highlighting the impracticality of them. Product specialists from other brands were also very unimpressed by their handiwork at efficiency. Speaks volumes for the next guy running “efficiency”.

So.  It's been a year since this post.  I have been trying to work with SDGE on and off for the last 12 months.  Was out to sea for a huge chunk of it, bit trying to do what I can when I'm here.  I have been able to pay off a portion of what I owe, but my monthly electricity is still toping 700-800 a month, so catching up is almost impossible.  Every time I speak to them, they want 3-4k down payment and 1200 a month, on top of my electricity bill.  I tell them I literally can't afford that, they say to call back in a month after an extention.  

SDGE will be disconnecting my electricity on the 17th.  Its the last extension I have.  They last I talked to them, they wanted my entire balance (14k) or its disconnection.  I have asked them to investigate the extreme bills since I can't be using that, they don't care.

1hoehnk,Airport Transit Connection: People Mover > Trolley Branch,"SANDAG is proposing several concepts for the Airport Transit Connection.

The Automated People Mover (APM) concept is awesome. Trains every 2 minutes, connecting the Airport directly with Santa Fe Depot and Civic Center/Horton Plaza. The APM isn't a Tesla Tunnel. It's something like Vancouver's Skytrain, which in 2019 had higher ridership than the BART, despite Vancouver having far less people than the Bay Area. And there's no better way to own the NIMBYs than plopping down an elevated APM.

The Trolley Branch Concept sucks. It would merge onto existing Green/Blue Line tracks at Hawthorn, bottlenecking existing Trolley lines, and limiting frequencies on the Green, Mid-Coast, and Airport Trolleys to 10 minutes each. Screw that. We need the Green and Mid-Coast Trolleys to run as frequently as possible. One minute waiting at the station, going nowhere feels 2x-3x longer than one minute spent on board the train. We don't need a new Airport Trolley cannibalizing existing Trolley frequency. But oh well, the NIMBYs love the Trolley Branch Concept because it would re-use existing, street level tracks.

We need to DESTROY those NIMBYs, kill the Trolley Branch Concept, and support the APM!

1in5b6o,Enphase Energy Launches Expanded IQ Battery 5P Solution for New Home Projects in California | Enphase Energy,"With new **SDG&E tariffs now announced** and **10 AM - 2 PM changing to Super Off-Peak imminent**, this is a very good solution to consider.  I have no association with Enphase.

This will **work for those on a plan like EVTOU5** where there is a differential between Super Off-Peak (for charging the battery) and Off-Peak and On-Peak (to discharge the battery) rates.

With the latest tariffs, TOU5 differential (**SDG&E Delivery + Power100 SDCP**) between On-Peak and Super Off-Peak is around 62 cents/kWh in the summer.  Even with a 30% conservative derating to account for losses, that is 43 cents/kWh.  In the winter the final number is around 25 cents/kWh.  The batteries will cost you well under 20 c/kWh over their warranty period (15 years, roughly 1 discharge cycle a day).

You don't need Solar (yes!), you don't need full backup, you get these batteries in what is called a ""grid tied"" mode.  The battery will be setup in ""Import Only"" mode so you are not exporting back to the grid.  Very simple setup, one battery should cost you around $5000 installed (roughly 1 kWh per hour during On-Peak), two around $8000 installed (roughly 2 kWh per hour during On-Peak) if you shop around.  In Enphase's ecosystem, an installer installs the battery but Enphase supports it directly if you have any issues.  If the installer goes under (they die all the time), you simply move your Enphase ID to a different Enphase installer.",sandiego,https://www.reddit.com/r/sandiego/comments/1in5b6o/enphase_energy_launches_expanded_iq_battery_5p/,2/11/2025 18:19,1,10,california

1eydaxx,Help needed,"Hello everyone, unfortunately hindsight is 20/20 and I well could have prevented the predicament I find myself in. 

On July 31st around 5pm I was driving southbound on the 805 right after the 52 when all of the sudden a Tesla merged into my lane, I tired to avoid it without hitting the car on my right and it hit me. 

Here is the catch, I drive a motorcycle for my commute to work to save time and money. I have a family to get to and on the younger side so I don’t drive fast or crazy. I lane split only when traffic is really heavy and no faster than around 25mph which is way slower than what other bikers split at. 

At the time of the incident the driver admitted fault and was really sorry that they hadn’t seen me when they tried to merge blah blah blah. I was frustrated at the time because it was scary to know I could have been really hurt because of someone carelessness. Even the passenger came out to see if I was alright but I brushed him off. I ride all the gear necessary to prevent as much harm in case of an accident. 

 Now here is the catch, because it was a Tesla I thought it would have recorded everything like they all do but the other party is now saying it bugged out for that day (how convenient) and that it was all my fault. It is my word against the two of them.

In hope that someone may have saw what happened or better yet have a dashcam video that is the reason for this post. I won’t share too much information in case someone tries to fake a story for me which is not what I want. 

The same day I heard that from the insurance I ran to best buy to buy a go pro to record all my commuting. And I know I will get some down votes or hate because “oh you were probably splitting too damn fast” or “you bikers always drive erratically” which is not the case. 

Thanks in advance and for taking the time to read this. My insurance is dealing with it as well. No police report was made because we didn’t deem it necessary at the time. ",sandiego,https://www.reddit.com/r/sandiego/comments/1eydaxx/help_needed/,8/22/2024 7:30,12,22,california

I've already contacted the police, and they are currently investigating the case (Case #24203320 filed with SDPD).

A few days later, I saw a red Tesla with similar dents in the same area and took a picture of its license plate and the dents. I've shown this picture to the police and Tesla, but the police mentioned it still might not be sufficient evidence.

I'm reaching out to the community for any advice or insight that could help. Specifically, if anyone was in the area at that time and saw anything or has any additional information, it would be incredibly helpful. Additionally, if you've been in a similar situation, I'd appreciate any tips on how to handle this process and work with the police.

For privacy and to avoid any mistaken identity issues, I'm not posting the license plate of the Tesla with similar dents. However, I've included a generic picture of a red Tesla of the same model to help jog any memories.

As a Presidents Circle member, I booked a Tesla Model 3 online but opted to upgrade to a Model Y at the counter for an additional $14 per day - or so the associate told me. However, upon returning the vehicle, I discovered that the upgrade charge was actually $150 per day, not $14, which led to an extra $750 on my bill. I immediately protested this charge to Hertz, but they offered no resolution, forcing me to dispute the charge through AMEX. This experience showcased a level of dishonesty I've never encountered with other rental companies. Consider this a public service announcement: be wary of Hertz at SFO and always double-check your receipts.",sanfrancisco,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1c9muzi/beware_hidden_fees_my_750_overcharge_nightmare/,4/21/2024 17:01,132,58,california

1djb0fe,Street parking & scratched windows,"Sadly, two of my car (Tesla Model 3) windows have been keyed/scratched up in the past 2 weeks, producing some cracks.

I live in Mission and street park daily since my apartment doesn’t have a garage. I’ve been street parking for the past 8 months now without any incidents, and these 2 incidents have seemingly arisen out of nowhere.

Unfortunately, I didn’t have sentry mode turned on, so I have no idea who did this or what motivated them to do so. I didn’t park in a particularly shady area, nor did I park badly (e.g. far from the curb or in someone’s driveway), so these incidents seem to be acts of sheer wanton vandalism. I also don’t leave valuables in my car, and nothing is visible from the outside.

Some questions I had:
- Is it common for cars to be vandalized in SF? In Mission specifically?
- Are Teslas in particular a target for vandalism?
- How can I reduce the likelihood of more “incidents” going forward?

I'm honestly not sure how to get started with this, especially checking if there are any permits I need to get approved. Thanks in advance for any help/guidance you can provide:

Good Morning, 

Thank you for the service request. If this request is to install your own EV charging station & meter with PG&E you are more than welcome to do so. Should you choose to install your own EV charging station, you would be responsible for any costs associated with installing, maintaining, or repairing the hardware as well as creating a new account with PG&E for the utility bills associated with the separate meter. Additional details for this process may be found below: 

EV Charger Installation Requirements  


The tenant is required to submit their request to install the EV charging station in writing – including a description of the proposed install area, documents showing cost & space area to install EV charging station with emergency stop rail/bar  

The tenant is responsible for all costs associated with installing, operating, and maintaining the charging station – including installation of the proper level PG&E meter.   

The tenant is responsible to pay for and obtain any required permits  

The tenant is responsible to pay costs for damage, maintenance, repair, removal, and replacement of the EV charging station   

Tenant must either:   

Agree to obtain personal liability insurance coverage to cover property damage and personal injury caused by the EV charging station in compliance with Civil Code 1947.6(h). With policy limits not to exceed ten times annual rent for the unit, the policy must remain in full force and effect so long as the EV charging station exists or until the tenant vacates.  

Insurance is not needed if the charging station was certified by a nationally recognized testing laboratory, as approved by OSHA; and, a licensed electrician performs the work (please note, all vendors who work at our properties MUST be licensed and insured).   

Tenants are required to sign an addendum to the lease acknowledging and agreeing to the information included above.

1codwts,Electric Chargers for Renters in CA - HOA? ,"So Califonia law allows a resident to have their landlord put in charging stations if:

 

·         EV Charging stations dont already exist

·         Parking is provided as part of the lease agreement

·         There are not fewer than five parking spaces

·         The unit is not subject to rent control

·         The building is not over the limit for electrical capacity

·         The renter has 1MM Liability Policy on Renter Insurance

·         The renter has to remove it after if the landlord requests

 

I live in a building with about 50 parking spots, is condo’s and has an HOA. Can I still force my landlord to let me pay for the installation of the charging station? I have two spots actually. The big thing is how would this work with an HOA. Would I have to convince the HOA to let me or because of the law would I be allowed to install chargers regardless of the HOA if it meets the criteria. I have a friend who owns an electric company and said he would send out his electricians to do an assessment of costs and such. My question is how would the HOA react and could they stop it from happening. Does the law supersede anything the HOA can do?

For the type of charger looks like level 1 is allowed, level 2 would be more questionable :

“For purposes of this section, “electric vehicle charging station” or “charging station” means any level of electric vehicle supply equipment station that is designed and built in compliance with Article 625 of the California Electrical Code, as it reads on the effective date of this section, and delivers electricity from a source outside an electric vehicle into a plug-in electric vehicle.”

Based on my reading of Article 625 of the California Electrical Code, Tesla's level 1 portable charger absolutely complies. There's no requirement that it must be hardwired or 240v or separately metered.

So do I need to worry about HOA’s in a unit that has 5 floors with about 20 apartments each floor and has 50+ parking spaces.",sanfrancisco,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1codwts/electric_chargers_for_renters_in_ca_hoa/,5/10/2024 1:38,4,12,california

1iavy6l,Trying to help a homeless acquaintance,"Trying to find solutions to help out our daughters dad.  

The TL:DR... he's originally from Asia. Has/had a Green card. He was laid off from tesla and fucked off getting unemployment. Evicted from his apartment. (Which he lied to us about)  Shortly after we took him to the hospital and got diagnosed with diabetes and non cancer brain tumor. Hospital tried to get him Medicaid but his green card is affecting that. He has no form of legal i.d. anymore that were aware of. We had him stay with us for now but he has GREATLY over welcomed his stay with us. He essentially refuses to do anything to help and is just cruising for free here. 

Wanted to get him to CARES but they have no guarantee to get a bed. And if you do it's only for one night at a time. Eddyhouse is for youth and rise is for single women and families not single men.

Trying to find a medical angle to get him a more solid housing situation. Or anything at all at this point. Will also try and contact the thai embassy to see if they can help out at all getting him back to Thailand where he has family.

1c6rtc0,Is Reno one of Elon musk's first cities that he conquers with layoffs and factory sweatshops before his ultimate dystopian takeover? I asked some AI about it and this is what they said,"https://youtu.be/z5rRZdiu1UE?si=3O0IvCq40X0kXRwp

Perhaps sabotage is not just a Beastie boys song. Would it be nice to see Tesla unionized? Stuff to see fascist Elon in all of his glory. Power corrupts absolute power absolutely. Or, on the other hand, it's been a long time since we've seen a conquistador. What lies in the future? I asked some open ai And these are two possible scenarios


Integrating Elon Musk's recent outspoken public behavior and political views into a hypothetical scenario that considers the potential for his acquisition of vast power raises concerns reminiscent of historical examples of political fascists and populists. Let’s revise and expand the hypothetical timeline:

**2025**: Musk’s increasingly vocal political stances begin to echo through his enterprises. Tesla, SpaceX, and Neuralink start reflecting his ideological leanings, incorporating them into corporate missions and consumer relationships. His public denouncements and endorsements sway stock markets and political races alike.

**2030**: Musk's public persona evolves. He adopts a more authoritative, direct communication style that resonates with a significant following. This shift, combined with his technological influence, begins to mirror the early stages of historical populist movements, where charismatic leadership blurs the lines between corporate power and political ambition.

**2035**: Drawing parallels with historical figures like Mussolini or Perón, Musk's merging of his personal ideology with his corporate policies begins to influence national and international policies directly. His control over information through Starlink and his influence in AI through Neuralink give him tools that no populist leader in the past ever had, raising significant concerns about privacy, surveillance, and free expression.

**2040**: Musk’s rhetoric and control mechanisms start to crystallize into a more cohesive political force. Like past fascists, he leverages national crises and global instability to propose sweeping changes that consolidate his control, often at the expense of civil liberties. His platforms become echo chambers that amplify his views and suppress dissent.

**2045**: As the climate crisis worsens, Musk positions himself as the only one capable of leading humanity through it, using his technologies and space colonization plans. This 'savior' narrative is similar to past authoritarian practices where leaders manipulated public fears and hopes to enhance their power.

**2050**: Musk's role as a global leader is uncontested due to his monopolistic control over essential technologies and media. Like past dictators, his regime begins to show overt authoritarian traits—control is maintained by surveillance, manipulation of information, and by promoting a cult of personality.

**2055**: A major system failure or scandal in one of Musk’s companies reveals the vulnerabilities in having so much power concentrated in one entity. However, by this time, global dependence on his technologies makes it difficult to disentangle his influence from world governance.

**2060**: The backlash begins as global populations and surviving democratic institutions push back against Musk’s autocratic control. This period could echo historical moments like the fall of authoritarian regimes through grassroots movements and international pressure.

In this revised scenario, Musk’s recent psychological changes and outspoken public lifestyle exacerbate the risks associated with his technological and political dominance. The historical parallels drawn with fascists and populists underscore the need for robust checks and balances in democratic societies. This speculative exploration serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of charismatic leadership intertwined with significant control over technology and information, urging vigilance and proactive governance to prevent potential dystopian futures.


Certainly! Here's the English translation of the updated essay:

When considering the worst-case scenarios that could arise from Elon Musk's rise to power, it's important to not only focus on his accumulation of influence across various industries but also to take note of the recent psychological changes he has displayed through his outspoken public lifestyle and political views. These changes may indicate a disturbing pattern that bears similarities to political fascists and populists of the past.

Musk's recent statements and actions have raised questions about his motivations and intentions. His use of social media has increasingly shown an intolerance for criticism and a suppression of dissent. His interventions in politics have also become more overt, often supporting controversial figures and policies. This behavior evokes parallels to historical authoritarians who leveraged their influence to shape narratives in their favor and quash opposition.

If Musk continues along this path, his psychological shifts could combine with his growing power and influence to lead to a dark future. He may exploit his control over critical industries and platforms to push extreme political agendas, suppress dissent, and consolidate his position as an unquestioned leader.

Historical fascist and populist leaders have often followed similar patterns. They used charisma and influence to gain followers, then leveraged that support to consolidate power and eliminate opposition. They manipulated media narratives, stoked division, and called for action against perceived enemies. Over time, their rule became increasingly authoritarian and oppressive.

While Musk's current actions have not reached such extremes, it is important to recognize the potential warning signs and take action to prevent this dark future from becoming a reality. This includes demanding checks and balances on power, promoting openness and transparency, and upholding democratic principles.

We must also pay attention to the mental health and well-being of influential figures like Musk. The pressures of power and the risk of becoming detached from reality can profoundly impact individuals and lead to dangerous behavior. By providing support and resources, and encouraging responsible and compassionate leadership, we can help prevent individuals from descending into authoritarianism and oppression.

Overall, while Musk's case is still unfolding, it provides an important case study for how we view power, influence, and leadership. By learning from the lessons of the past, remaining vigilant, and actively shaping our collective future, we can strive to create a more just, democratic, and equitable world.",Reno,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reno/comments/1c6rtc0/is_reno_one_of_elon_musks_first_cities_that_he/,4/18/2024 2:01,0,11,nevada
1c8sclc,"Seeking Collaborators for a Dark, Moody Arthouse Short Film Project in Reno/Sparks","Hey r/Filmmakers,

Two years ago, I moved my family to Sparks, and now that I'm more (or less) settled, I'm itching to get a new short film off the ground. I don't have any local connections yet — my neighbor, who has a film degree, but works at Tesla, is the only person I know so far...

A bit about my background: My filmmaking journey began at Disney Studios in 1989, an experience that was great, but unfulfilling nonetheless. Since then, I've climbed down the ladder of filmmaking and only work on personal projects now, wearing lots of hats — writing, directing, editing (Davinci Resolve), CGI, AI composition —  all the while balancing a ***stable*** and consistent career in order to support my family. Currently, my job is with one of our National Labs within the Nuclear Division of the Department of Energy, but my passion for film remains undiminished.

I'm fully equipped for production with a couple of Blackmagic Design 4K cameras, booms, jigs, glides, lighting equipment, field recording equipment and a DJI drone. I'll handle the production costs (to a point :), but *it's important to note that this is a volunteer project and there won't be pay involved.*  ***This is for fun.***

Personally, I'm dealing with a mother-effer of a health challenge — a rare tumor, about the size of a jellybean, growing **INSIDE** my spinal cord (I've definitely won the Powerball of worst places to have a tumor) which underscores my urgency to create something wonderful while I still can. This project is not just a creative outlet but also a means to keep my thoughts off of the thing inside my spine...

Anyway, I digress...

The film I want to make is a surreal, modern retelling of the [Orpheus/Eurydice myth](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/foundations/orpheus-and-eurydice), set in the Nevada desert. The narrative follows a lone cowboy with a guitar and his descent into the underworld of one of the caves around here to rescue his wife from the Rattlesnake Lord. The film will be dark and moody, visually and thematically rich, intertwining the nature of love and the defiance of fate. The overall theme is inspired by [Dylan Thomas’ poem, ""And Death Shall Have No Dominion.""](https://poets.org/poem/and-death-shall-have-no-dominion) It will explore themes of undying love, loss, and the rebellious human spirit that refuses to be quashed by death.

The script is nearing completion and will be finalized within the next two weeks or so, although it will remain flexible for adjustments during the shooting process to best capture our vision.

For those interested in my previous work, here is a link to the music video for [Tom Waits' ""Soldier's Things,""](https://youtu.be/qwg3y_FnLmg) which I directed in 1989. It provides a taste of the style and mood I bring to my projects.

Here is a photo of myself, my friend Tom, and another colleague :)

[I refuse to name-drop, so here is a photo taken while we were implementing a pyrotechnic system at Disney Studios - That's me on the left.](https://preview.redd.it/kl6jfc6tanvc1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=867a674daad1c2749f6730c7cb22faf652248083)

My aim is to submit this film to various film competitions and festivals, such as SXSW, Sundance, Tribeca, Cannes Short Film Corner, etc., etc., starting out with much smaller competitions. 

So, I’m looking for like-minded collaborators who are drawn to creating deeply atmospheric and thought-provoking films. If you're in the Reno/Sparks area and this project resonates with you, please get in touch. Let’s make something profound and hopefully, unpretentious together!

I'll be 60 years old (somehow), in July. It would be nice to also work with folks my age who had to choose Plan B because of life getting in the way...

Thank you for considering this opportunity. I look forward to the possibility of working with some of you soon.

Best regards,  
Eric

* I see that the PUC allows operation of virtual power plants. Does anyone make any money on this program, and if so, how much? Is this pretty much exclusively a Tesla thing, or can you do this with any provider that supports VPP?

* Does anyone have the system installed on the outside of their house? Our garage is pretty tight, and we can't imagine having solar backup + eventual EV chargers, but we do have a side of the house that's just a straight up wall.

1iuc6rg,Update on /r/Austin Rules and Mod Policies,"BAs you've probably noticed, the mod team has been revising how we approach moderation and used the last week to collect data on a much more hands off approach. 

For details on the data, see my comment below. 

## What we noticed

- More content variety is enjoyed:
  - Effort is appreciated, more generic questions are ok.
  - People want more event posts!
	- Question to y'all(/r/Austin): How should mods manage folks trying to what is essentially advertising their event for money?
  - Mixed results on ""Ask Austin questions"" -- a lot of them could be solved with a search.
  - rental/buying/moving here type questions just don't do well

- Political content is highly upvoted and poorly discussed:

  - Several presidents day threads posted, upvoted and discussed.... then deleted.
  - The result with having multiple threads is that discussion/organizing fails to happen.
	- Example: See the multiple President's day Protests, try to find *the* thread folks are using to discuss it and organize.
  - Outright *wrong* information is upvoted as well as generic political stuff
	- Upvotes do a good job of determining what is popular, not what is relevant or specific to Austin

## Actions we are taking:

- We will allow more political posts
  - Users posting political content should have some history of contributions to /r/Austin - we're not going to allow fly-by users who just show up here to push a political agenda.
- Go back to enforcing civility and relevancy on all posts
  - Productive discussion -- especially on political posts -- requires guard rails. If you want to just insult each other, do it somewhere else.
  - We are still going to remove posts that have little relevance/specificness to Austin (for example, just because it involves Greg Abbott doesn't make it immediately relevant to Austin. If you want general state politics, try /r/Texas or /r/TexasPolitics instead), but we will be more permissive here than we have been in the past.

- Post titles for articles should follow the article title/subject, and post titles that aren't for articles still need to accurately describe the topic in question.  *Readers should always be able to tell what the thread is about just by reading the title.*
  - Injecting an opinion into the title, such as ""it's about time..."" will get it removed.  Titles should be descriptive and yet not politically or emotionally charged.
  - We'll have a certain amount of leeway here so don't worry about it too much unless it's a hot-button issue. 

- Megathreads will be used less often than we have in the past
	- Without a megathread or otherwise organized posting, the result has shown that discussion is scattered across multiple threads.
	- We will not remove photo posts/articles or reasonable questions but we reserve the right to lock/restrict comments to community members. We will try to err on NOT doing this though. 

- Go back to using a weekly real estate thread as a collection for ""moving here"" questions. Keep general building/etc questions here.
    - ""[Would anyone recommend a realtor that they have personally worked with or not recommend a particular one?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1ir8t94/would_anyone_recommend_a_realtor_that_they_have/)"" = removed if in its own thread, but OK in the weekly real estate thread.
    - ""[Anyone know on average how long developments take to get started?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1ir8u6g/anyone_know_on_average_how_long_developments_take/)"" = OK

- Continuing to remove any ""selling/need to hire someone"" posts.
  - We're not going to be the garage sale for Austin nor do we want to act as a marketplace -- r/AustinClassifieds is perfect for that.
  - Also not allowing ""Can I ride with anyone...""

- Allowing more events/professional posts.
  - Examples: Casting calls/free teeth cleaning, etc. -- these usually have some public appeal.
  - There will be some amount of self-promoting but posts from users who have not contributed in /r/Austin will likely be removed/pushed to weekly event thread. 

- Allow more Austin restaurant posts:
  - /r/AustinFood, is one of the biggest subreddits of it's kind -- we should use it!
  - To that end, we're going to still remove ""review"" posts and generic ""seeking"" type posts. ""Best bar?
  - We will allow the asking of more questions, however.  For example, we'll go back to allowing more generic food posts like grocery/where to find <x> as long as it's not low effort.
	- ""[Best bars to go to solo](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1iov3bj/best_bars_to_go_to_solo/)"" = OK as long as we don't get dozens of them a week.
	- ""[ISO thai tea leaves](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1irbbzc/iso_thai_tea_leaves/)"" = OK
	- ""[I had Whataburger last night for the first time in over 3 years, and it was delicious.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1iqyuw8/i_had_whataburger_last_night_for_the_first_time/)"" = Removed

- Continue to remove mod-determined ""low effort"" post -- you need to put some effort into your posts!
     - Where should I eat - ""I like food and cannot be more specific."" = removed.
     - ""I need to see <x> - please recommend one for me."" = removed
     - ""I need a thing/trade/service. Please recommend THE BEST, cheap, and fastest one."" = removed
     - Basically - if you invest no effort in asking your question, it gets removed and a better subreddit may be recommended if it exists.
        - ""[Best affordable massages in Austin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1irfc45/best_affordable_massages_in_Austin/)"" = removed
        - ""[Recs for Austin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1irc070/recs_for_Austin/)"" = removed
        - ""[Therapy](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1ioxnai/therapy/)"" = the question is good, but use a better title!

- Allowing more reposts on the same topic...when it makes sense.
  - We've been overzealous with the ""Removed - that topic was posted 4 month ago"" removals.
  - To that end, subjects that were posted a while ago and where having another discussion is not likely to turn toxic will be OK.
  - Political/event posts are a special type and we'll probably allow them for reminding/organizing but it'll need to stay civil or get locked.
  - If a question gets posted and there's already a recent thread, we'll add which thread to use and remove the new thread.
	- Example: Someone posts ""Protest starting at 11AM near front lawn Capitol"" and then a little bit after someone asks ""When/where is the protest?"" - we will remove that question and link to the first post.

- Allow more ""not necessarily Austin related/specific"" stuff.
  - ""[So which is it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1imgzv5/so_which_is_it/)"" -- the topic was about red wasps, which aren't specific to Texas at all, but we're inclined to allow this sort of thing -- *but it will require a more descriptive title*.
  - Need something that's more about Texas and less about Austin specifically?  Maybe we'll allow it maybe not ... it'll depend on the specifics.
     - This doesn't mean ""well, it happened in Texas and Austin is in Texas."" or ""Well, company <X> is in the Austin area."" is OK -- we're going to need it to be more specific than that.
  - ""[How to get insurance with a learners permit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1iraoe4/how_to_get_an_insurance_with_learners_permit/)"" = OK - it's not Austin specific, but it's close enough that we'll probably permit it.
 - ""[Example of selling Tesla as a form of protest](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1ir39yu/example_of_selling_tesla_as_form_of_protest)"" = Removed

- We will continue removing content from new accounts whose sole contribution to /r/Austin is trolling, and will continue to ban the worst offenders, but will try to be a little slower with the ""ban"" option.

- We're going to remove the ""To the person who..."" type posts in most cases:
  - These posts are usually just someone [ranting at the sky](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/old-man-yells-at-cloud).
  - Sometimes they are complementary and those will often be allowed.
  - /r/Austin isn't your missed connections page....unless y'all want it to be? 
  	- ""[To the marathon gatekeepers](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1ir4lyo/to_the_marathon_gatekeepers/)"" = Removed
  	- ""[To the person that waved at me at 35 and MLK](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1iojwh0/to_the_person_that_waved_at_me_at_35_and_mlk/)"" = Removed
  	- ""[To the person who waved at me on airport and 290](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1io8f4w/to_the_person_who_waved_at_me_on_airport_and_290/)"" = OK
  	- ""[To the woman at the bar who made sure I got home](https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1ir80hj/to_the_woman_at_the_bar_who_made_sure_i_got_home/)"" = OK

- Hearsay policy and threads:
  - These are tough ones for us because these sort of threads are popular and can get whipped up into a frenzy *fast*.
	- When you provide hearsay, it's not provable and being dead wrong usually has no consequences to you, but it can have strong consequences for others.
        - The mod team has also had a long-standing policy to respect privacy.  We are receptive to discussion on this, but are not currently considering any changes to our policies here.
        - For more background on this, see site-wide reddit rule 3 [here](https://redditinc.com/policies/reddit-rules) -- we *have* to follow this policy, and there is not a lot of wiggle room left.

## This is all still a work in process, and so adjustments will be made.  Let us know what you think! 

## tldr;

- The past week has seen a sharp decline from a health/quality metrics point of view.
- Political discussions are going to require civil discourse between redditors or they will be banned.  You can insult politicians, public figures, etc but not each other.
- We are going to allow more events, questions about restaurants, and ""ask Austin"" sort of questions.
- We are still removing content that is not specific or related to Austin. But we're going to lower the bar - we've been too strict here.
- We are still re-evaluating things so we'll continue to change how we handle situations like protests. Please provide feedback!",Austin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1iuc6rg/update_on_raustin_rules_and_mod_policies/,2/20/2025 23:05,364,157,texas

Just wanted to post this funny moment :)

When we got to the dirt road heading to the parking lot, there was so much overflow that people were parking on either side of the narrowest part where realistically, only one car can fit. That didn't stop a Tesla driver from doing a multipoint turn at that very part instead of sucking it up and going into the lot to turn around and come back around the right way, holding up traffic in both directions.

We ended up parking further out and hiking in. Once we got the lot, there were giant bags of garbage dumped outside of the only bathroom there. That pretty much set the tone for the rest of the walk. 

I saw multiple bags of abandoned dog shit, which has become all too common on Washington trails. Someone even got so creative as to leave one on top of an information sign. I was even lucky enough to step in some that a thoughtful dog owner left behind without even attempting to bag it.

But the best part was finding a steaming pile of human shit and wet wipes on a path that followed a creek off the side of the main paved trail. I can handle the crowds and too many cars, but dog and human shit? That's just ridiculous.

1enry40,WA EV instant rebate - Math seems too good to be true?,"WA introduced the EV Instant rebate of $9000 for 36+ month leases this month. I qualify for it and I'm trying to estimate what my monthly payment would be for a Tesla Model 3 on a 36 month lease.

I'm going by the calculation shown in the screenshot (shown below) from the WA commerce website.

Based on the Tesla website the cost to lease a Model 3 RWD is: For $0 down payment, it is $440/mo with $2k due at signing (est. taxes and fees), without any rebates applied.

Total cost of leasing the car : (440 \* 36) + 2000 = $17840

WA State rebate + Federal rebate = $9000 + $7500 (I've confirmed that the rebates do stack)

So the effective cost of the car is = 17840 - 16500 = $1340. Or if you remove the $2k that is due at signing, it becomes 15840 which is lesser than the rebate I am eligible for. 

What am I missing here? Can someone please help me understand the proper math behind what I'd be paying monthly? Even the Tesla dealership I went to did not have a clue how this would work. Thanks!

1cmtt1f,I find ppl don't know they can dispute their RTA tax. (and how),"RTA (Regional Transit Authority) tax: if you're here and own a car, you're probably paying it.

It's an annual tax based on the value of your car, to construct regional transit.

When you buy a new car, the tax rate is 1.1% of MSRP. The base value depreciates each year.

------

Problem is oftentimes DOL gets an incorrect MSRP -- either higher or lower. 

**Remember: dispute only when the real MSRP is LOWER than the taxed MSRP, otherwise you'll end up with owing DOL cash.**

------

A good example is Tesla's price cuts in the past 2 years, if you purchased a Tesla recently, chances are your RTA tax is overcharged.

I bought a Model 3 at the MSRP $40,240 last Sept., the MSRP was based on $517/1.1% = $47,000.

You need to call DOL (360-902-3770 from [https://dol.wa.gov/vehicles-and-boats/taxes-fuel-tax-and-other-fees/regional-transit-authority-rta-tax](https://dol.wa.gov/vehicles-and-boats/taxes-fuel-tax-and-other-fees/regional-transit-authority-rta-tax)), tell the rep the your plate # and the MSRP is wrong.

The rep will ask for your email, and days later you will receive an email from [RTARedund@dol.wa.gov](mailto:RTARedund@dol.wa.gov) asking for 2 docs you can get from your Tesla account:

After sending the docs, you can sit and wait for the refund check to come:

The $74 refund might not seem a lot, but remember this is an annual tax, so you get the benefit (or punishment if you don't dispute) every year.

I also have a 2017 VW SUV, I moved to WA in 2020 and paid the RTA tax without knowing anything about it. After some calculation I'm sure I'm overcharged.

Two weeks ago I called DOL and went through the process again, the only difference is the docs I sent to [RTARedund@dol.wa.gov](mailto:RTARedund@dol.wa.gov) 

https://preview.redd.it/42t5bbfb54zc1.png?width=1502&format=png&auto=webp&s=9059df5c14702a5da7be63f7296d32e7ee17f69a

DOL adopted my suggest price and I get the refund very soon:

But nope.... Seattle City Lights still in 2024 does not have any sort of program set up yet. They have now pushed back the program until 2025 (we will see).

1bz0t0o,Project Macoma Elwha nearshore,"From: **Anne Shaffer** <[anne.shaffer@coastalwatershedinstitute.org](mailto:anne.shaffer@coastalwatershedinstitute.org)\>  
Date: Sat, Apr 6, 2024 at 3:24 PM  
Subject: FW: Project Macoma Elwha nearshore \_4  
To: <[anne.shaffer@coastalwatershedinstitute.org](mailto:anne.shaffer@coastalwatershedinstitute.org)\>

We’re letting folks know about an important marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) project proposed for the area. It’s a pilot project by a subsidiary of Ebb Carbon, the founders of which include executives from Google, Tesla, and Amazon. The project partners are the Port of Port Angeles, Battelle, and the University of Washington. From the JARPA application SEPA checklist materials submitted to the Port and Washington Department of Ecology (DoE), the goal of the project is to test the feasibility of ‘scrubbing’ CO2 from marine water using intensive chemical technology, by a process that will, quote: ‘create an alkaline enhanced stream that would be returned to Port Angeles Harbor via the barge-based outfall system. The facility is to be built on Terminal 7 in Port Angeles harbor. Both intake and outflow structures ***will be shallow***\*.\* ***Outflow/effluent will be from 17 to 30 degrees C and pH of 2.3-13.9, quote:’ the pH of the water could be altered from approximately 8 to 13.5 pH for ‘short periods of time’ (a single tidal cycle***\*)’\* *(emphasis added)*

In short, the project creates a hostile ‘dead zone’ of caustic hot water with temperatures up to 30 degrees C and pH of 13-14 in the nearshore of Port Angeles Harbor, a region of the Elwha drift cell, that is to be resolved by ‘mixing’ with harbor water that is the migration corridor/contains post-larval and juvenile salmon and forage fish.

An earlier version of the project was conducted off a pier in Sequim Bay. In this phase, post treatment effluent was run thru a water treatment facility before being released back into marine waters. Inexplicably, the Port Angeles Harbor project doesn’t include this treatment phase, and instead releases caustic, hot water directly into the nearshore.

The Port of Port Angeles, the project sponsor, issued itself a SEPA Determination of Non Significance (DNS). DoE is still considering their NPDS permit. If approved, this is precedent setting. It allows clearly avoidable impacts to a federally protected nearshore ecosystem/habitats/ and species, and does so in the Elwha drift cell, one of the most celebrated and significant drift cells in the Salish Sea.

The Coastal Watershed Institute provided an initial set of comments (attached). Instead of addressing these, Ebb Carbon applied to DoE for a ‘determination that lowering of water quality is necessary and in the overriding public interest’.  In translation: they are proposing that mCDR research supersedes both the federal Endangered Species Act, and the Elwha River Fisheries and Ecosystem Recovery Act. Remember, this project is proposed in the nearshore of the Elwha watershed and drift cell where literally hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to restore ESA ecosystems exactly when the ESA species and ecosystems are starting to restore.

We strongly recommend that state, federal, and Tribal co-managers reject these decisions and instead require that full and substantive avoidance mitigation measures for this project, including its’ water quality impacts. Particularly in light of the critical nature of nearshore habitats of the Salish Sea region, the hundreds of millions of dollars of public tax dollars spent on current and past ecosystem restoration actions in the region for the last quarter of a century, and the potential negative impacts of this project on ecosystem scale restoration response now underway. At a minimum, the effluent from this project must be conveyed to a water treatment system (as was apparently required for Sequim Bay/Dungeness drift cell) and treated so that the water quality of the project effluent is equal or better than the water quality at withdrawal.

And of course in the current framework we also recommend that EPA require that the Washington Department of Ecology require the applicant to apply all known and reasonable technology (AKART) to their discharge to meet State of Washington Water Quality Standards for protection of migratory fish life documented to be within the discharge zone, and that all numeric and narrative water quality standards are met.

Finally, it should be considered that this project is basically a “proof of concept” phase for a commercial product that will be offered for sale by a for-profit corporation using Waters of the State for private gain without mitigation. In our opinion, implementation of Project Macoma in its’ current form only benefits Project Macoma and parent company Ebb Carbon, not the public and not the ecological resource we all want (and have invested so much public tax dollar) to conserve and restore.

The comment period for DoE decisions on this NPDES permit, including the abdication of public interest, is open. The link to provide input is below. We are encouraging folks to please take a few minutes to review our comments, and then provide input/ comment to DoE, EPA, and other resource managers including CoE, WDFW, and DNR.

Remarkable that we are even having to post this.

• An electrician told me I’d need either a **subpanel** or a **full panel upgrade** to add a 50A breaker.

• I was originally planning to install a **NEMA 14-50 outlet**, but I’ve read that NEC 2023 **requires GFCI protection**, which can cause **nuisance tripping** with EV chargers.

• Now, I’m considering a **hardwired** Tesla Wall Connector.

1. **NEMA 14-50 vs. Hardwired Charger** – Which one would you recommend, and why?

2. **GFCI Tripping Issues** – Has anyone in Texas/Austin had trouble with GFCI protection on a NEMA 14-50?

Every time I see a Cybertruck I joke with my partner that “well now my day is ruined”. 

HOWEVER, I know a lot of people who bought Teslas before we knew anything about who Elon really was and what he supported. Harassing your allies based off of what you perceive from a purchase (and a pretty significant and binding purchase at that) is feeding into exactly what they want.

I'm not interested in reading personal journals, seeing posts about things that happen in every city or all the stupid shit posts.

I don't give a flying fuck that you throw cheese on your neighbor's car, smelled a fart, fell off your scooter, got honked at, overheard a conversation, missed a connection, can't adopt a dog, had a runny nose, like hummingbirds, have a kid that rides a short bus or whatever else happened in your life today. I am not interested in your personal essay about how you cry on public transportation. I don't care that you just visited Seattle and loved/hated it.

Teslas, lime scooters, bumper stickers, graffiti, unleashed dogs, bad drivers/parkers are not related to Seattle in any way, even if you see them in Seattle. If you ever leave Seattle, you'll understand that these things are in EVERY city. 

No, I'm not looking for r/SeattleWA or r/AskSeattle. I just want a sub with posts *related to Seattle*... community events, local politics, live music & sports, local businesses to support… without everyone's thoughts & feelings in Seattle.

e051c,Mechanical engineering Student looking for an internship in Colorado,"I love Colorado. I love snow skiing, rock climbing, mountain biking and the general attitude of people I have met there. I am a senior mechanical engineering student in the honors program at the University of Tennessee and will be graduating in December 2011. I am also getting a minor in business. I am looking for a summer internship beginning in Mid May with a construction or renewable energy company in Colorado. I have been applying online to various companies but with the way online applications are I feel they are almost useless. I have sent out cover letters and resumes to different engineers but haven't had much luck. I am now hoping Reddit can help me. Pay really is not a big issue if future employment after graduation is possible. I have been to Colorado many times in the winter but never had the chance to go in summer. I plan to live there after graduation and am hoping to align myself with a company early.

My dad started his own residential building company before I was born so I have been around construction and job sites my whole life. I saw every aspect of the business from floor plan design to closing. Honestly, I probably could have built a decent single family home by the age of 15. I spent a lot more time around heavy machinery than most. As a kid I took everything apart like a good engineer in training. I knew I was going to study mechanical engineering in college but it is not what I was expecting. I was really expecting more hands on and building. I have done well but am getting discouraged with my upper level classes. As a kid I was able to use my dad's tools to build anything imaginable but have not been able to do projects like I used to. I am ready to do actual work again and see projects completed. I grew up admiring Leonardo da Vinci, Nikola Tesla, and Einstein and love reading the works of these geniuses. I truly love learning and spend some of my free time reading textbooks and learning as much as possible about anything.

During the summer of 2010, I spent 6 weeks in Pamplona, Spain taking courses on Spanish and renewable energy. The region of Spain I was in produces 70% of its energy needs form renewable sources. The classroom work was discussion based led by local engineers working for various companies. The class work was supplemented with visits to solar and wind farms, a mini hydroelectric dam, and a large scale biomass boiler, as well as a carbon emission neutral building. We discussed and compared international energy policy with the policy of the US (or lack thereof). Apart from classes, I also had the time of my life Running with the Bulls and watching Spain win the World Cup.

I understand the need for corporate responsibility in regards to environmental issues and climate change. My study abroad experience changed my attitude towards energy production and waste. Especially after the monstrosity that was the BP oil spill, it is important now to change the way we view energy production in this country.

I was also voted Time's Man of the Year in 2006 if that is worth anything. (Seriously, look it up)

I don't know if this post is a job request, a plea for help, or just a misguided attempt to impress someone enough to PM me regarding possible employment. I will be on vacation in the Vail area for the first week of January 2011 and will be more than happy to give up a day of skiing to meet with someone anywhere close by. Thanks for reading this reddit and if you know of any opportunities please let me know. I can easily send a resume if that is needed (I've done it plenty already).

tl;dr- I want to work in Colorado.

205eli,Chris Christie and the State of NJ -Vs- Tesla Motors,"Since 2013, Tesla Motors has been working constructively with the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (NJMVC) and members of Governor Christie’s administration to defend against the New Jersey Coalition of Automotive Retailers’ (NJ CAR) attacks on Tesla’s business model and the rights of New Jersey consumers. Until yesterday, we were under the impression that all parties were working in good faith.

Unfortunately, Monday we received news that Governor Christie’s administration has gone back on its word to delay a proposed anti-Tesla regulation so that the matter could be handled through a fair process in the Legislature. The Administration has decided to go outside the legislative process by expediting a rule proposal that would completely change the law in New Jersey. This new rule, if adopted, would curtail Tesla’s sales operations and jeopardize our existing retail licenses in the state. Having previously issued two dealer licenses to Tesla, this regulation would be a complete reversal to the long standing position of NJMVC on Tesla’s stores. Indeed, the Administration and the NJMVC are thwarting the Legislature and going beyond their authority to implement the state’s laws at the behest of a special interest group looking to protect its monopoly at the expense of New Jersey consumers. This is an affront to the very concept of a free market.

Proposal PRN 2013-138 seeks to impose stringent licensing rules that would, among other things, require all new motor vehicles to be sold through middlemen and block Tesla’s direct sales model. This move comes in spite of discussions with the Governor’s staff as recently as January, when it was agreed that Tesla and NJ CAR would address their issues in a more public forum: the New Jersey Legislature. Instead, rather than engage in an open debate on such a significant policy issue, the Administration has expedited the implementation of a new law that the Commission intends to stealthily approve at a meeting in Trenton today at 2:00 PM EDT.

We are disappointed in the actions of the NJMVC and the Christie Administration, which come on the heels of more than nine months of unexplained delays in the issuing of a new sales license for Tesla, despite our numerous requests, calls, and letters. In addition, the NJMVC has also delayed the annual renewal of Tesla’s current dealer licenses without indication of the cause of the delay. The delays have handicapped Tesla in New Jersey, where, without clear licensing procedures and fair enforcement of existing law, we have been forced to delay our growth plans. This is an issue that affects not just Tesla customers, but also New Jersey citizens at large, because Tesla would be unable to create new jobs or participate in New Jersey’s economic revival.

At the same time, neither Tesla nor the taxpayers of New Jersey have been able to participate in any of the analysis or been granted a hearing as requested last year when this was first proposed. Despite being the subject of the regulation, we were only able to obtain information about today’s meeting with less than 24 hours notice and in direct contravention of assurances by the Governor.

We strongly believe it is vital to introduce our own vehicles to the market because electric cars are still a relatively new technology. This model is not just a matter of selling more cars and providing optimum consumer choice for Americans, but it is also about educating consumers about the benefits of going electric, which is central to our mission to accelerate the shift to sustainable transportation, a new paradigm in automotive technology.

We urge the Christie administration to act in good faith and withdraw the proposed amendment, or amend it so that it reflects the true intent of the Legislature and the people of New Jersey.

3aimn2,Dealer Plates!,"So what's up with Dealer plates down here? I've lived in AZ for over a decade now, but just recently I've been seeing dealer plates like crazy. Literally, I cannot go a day out on the road without at least seeing one.

But it's not just the fact that I see them. It's that I see them on expensive vehicles. Vehicles that appear to be *personal* vehicles. At odd places that a dealer shouldn't be going to on a work day. Hospitals, colleges, the hardware store, etc. Aren't dealer plates meant to be the plates used during a test drive? Are these dealers using them as their personal plates to avoid having to pay tabs or something? I've seen them on everything from Corvettes to Cadillac Escalades to Teslas.

3l824k,Why the Responsible Ohio rush?,"So, Issue 3 is getting pushed really big right now. Many people are saying ""This is the only chance we get!"" and ""It'll take this kind of funding to pass an amendment"". You know what, Responsible Ohio knows that. This is the only chance they'll get to lock in the oligarchy of pot control that their investors want so badly. 

Surely you've all seen the thing on the front page today about [Colorado revenues](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/colorado-history-bringing-taxes-marijuana-alcohol-time/). You see, Responsible Ohio and its investors see the writing on the wall. It's not much longer before this goes federal. And when it does, they want their oligarchical control over production in the state and over sales in the stores. Sure, there will be stores, but by the amendment they can only sell things produced by the amendment sanctioned growers. Nothing else. No competition from the rest of the nation. So, you vote this in now, you will in perpetuity get to live under that control. 

What? Fixed you say? Don't you see the cognitive dissonance that allows ""it'll take this kind of funding to pass an amendment"" but not ""it'll take this kind of funding to fix an amendment""? Where's THAT funding going to come from? The investors that now have an oligarchy and are making lots of money? Nooope, that money is going to go into fighting it, turning it into ""it's taking that kind of money to stop it from being fixed."" 

So yes. That's why Responsible Ohio is pushing this so hard right now. They're looking to lock in a thing they could otherwise never get. 

Me? I'm voting to permanently block this kind of amendment by voting for Issue 2. But, you know what, I've decided to refrain from voting on Issue 3 at all. I'll let you guys hang yourselves by your own petards if Issue 2 doesn't save the state from this kind of idiocy.",Ohio,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/3l824k/why_the_responsible_ohio_rush/,9/16/2015 21:31,35,64,ohio

5q4aet,Any Tesla Model 3 reservation holders?,"As Tesla does not have a store or service center in Mississippi, I'm not sure if customers would have to purchase and pickup their vehicle out of state or would have it delivered to them.

The MS sales tax of 5% on automobiles and light trucks (10,000 lbs. or less).

The MS Dept. of Revenue ""Use Tax FAQ"" says:
When a Mississippi resident purchases a vehicle out-of-state and brings it to Mississippi, is use tax due on the vehicle?

​Persons who purchase vehicles, which will be first registered and used in this state, from dealers located in other states (and these dealers are not registered with the Mississippi Department of Revenue) are liable for the payment of use tax at the same rate and on the same basis as sales tax. The Mississippi Use Tax is payable to the county Tax Collector if not previously paid to an authorized out-of-state dealer at the time of purchase. Credit for another state’s sales tax paid to a dealer in another state is not allowed against Mississippi Use Tax due on automobiles, motor homes, trucks, truck-tractors and semi-trailers, trailers, boats, travel trailers, motorcycles and all-terrain cycles.​

So you might have to pay another states sales tax and then 5% more in MS use tax.

Therefore I'm hoping Tesla will deliver or open a store.  It looks like they are allowed to, unlike in some other states that outlaw manufacturer direct sales.

Adam
Senator Kissel does not currently support the Tesla bill as written. He believes it is unfair to other car dealers. However, he has been in discussions with proponents and advocates for the bill. As it is only February the language of the bill could change significantly before it comes for a vote. As such we will monitoring it as it moves through the process.

When asked what changes he would have to see to support it. This is the reply that I have received


Adam
I'll share your thoughts with Senator Kissel. I do not have a detailed answer for you regarding changes as he does not sit on the committee of cognizance.
To date this session your emails are are the only ones we have 
received in support of the bill.

Well it was clear pretty early on that they didn't seem to actually be living in this unit. I've seen the same two women (mid 20s to mid 30s asian not sure of nationality. )about 3 times in the past 3 weeks but here is the thing every other day is a different car parked in the drive way. Stays for a couple hours of less then leaves. Its been a wide range from dirty old mini van and pickups to Tesla and suped up Subaru. No noise no shady people hanging out. But it just feels very off.

9bfvya,"So What Happened to ""Green Energy""? - An analysis. Is an 100% renewable grid possible for RI?","I've debated in the comment section with a good amount of people on whether a 100% renewable grid is feasible. Most people have been telling me that I'm short sighted, a fossil fuel shill, or just a plain moron.  I questioned myself, and then decided to do the math.

Figured my time to answer the question would be worth the public good.  Seems to be a popular topic with the governor signing an unenforceable executive order that encourages the state to attain 1,000 megawatts of renewable energy by 2020.  Alan Fung told the Cranston Herald ""Cranston to be the lead in the state in solar power"" and with Matt Brown saying ""Rhode Islanders would receive dividend checks every year from the profits generated by the [renewable] energy system, just as all residents of Alaska do.""

I'm pro-solar and pro-renewable, but there is some old school infrastructure needed to support them.  Nuclear would allow us to use 100% carbon free for baseload and sell the excess renewables to our neighbors.  Natural gas would allow us to turn on the plant when the renewables are down.  Anyways, let's get to the math.

RI used [182 trillion BTU or 53,338 GWh in energy over the course of 2016](https://www.eia.gov/state/print.php?sid=RI).  This includes electricity and home heating.  What would it take to generate this all from solar?

[Topaz Solar Farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topaz_Solar_Farm) in California generates 1268 GWh of electricity per year and covers roughly 9.5 sq miles.  It cost 2.5 billion to build.  Pretty modern and large plant built in 2014.  **It would take 42 plants to meet our energy needs in RI for 2016.** This is not accounting for the lesser sun in RI either.  With that, it would take 50 plants [(San Luis Obispo County has an avg Solar Radiation( kWh / m2 / day ) of 6.09 compared to Rhody's avg of 4.74)](https://pvwatts.nrel.gov/)

That would cost RI 105 billion dollars to build, and cover 400 sq miles.  Burrillville is only 60 sq miles... (interestingly enough the state budget is around 10 billion so plausible there).

What about wind?  Using [Thanet Wind Farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanet_Wind_Farm) as an example it would take 91 billion and 900 sq miles of ocean.  RI is about 1200 sq mi.

Next batteries, I was being lazy and only looked at monthly [peak monthly usage](https://www.iso-ne.com/isoexpress/web/reports/load-and-demand/-/tree/whlsecost-hourly-rhodeisland) for last winter with NE-ISO.  We use about 20,000 MW peak for pure electricity.  This estimate does not consider home heating in the winter, I'd assume that makes it much worse.  Would welcome any help here.    

If we assumed no wind and no solar during this time, we'd need 200 100MW Tesla grid storage batteries at a cost of 250/kWh.  This would cost 10 billion and cover 1 sq mile.  Would expect this to climb an order of magnitude higher accounting for capacity factor of renewables (~30%) and home heating.

**TD:LR To do renewables, roughly 12 years of the entire state budget diverted to energy and a third of the state covered in solar panels.  Hence why we need a plant until technology steadily improves.**

9pfnei,Michigan Tech Startup? Are you joking? - The true tech startup scene in Michigan,"Before writing this post, I literally search “Michigan Startups” on Reddit, There is 0 subreddit group result, The closest one is[ Ann Arbor Startups](https://www.reddit.com/r/annarborstartups/) with 22 subscribers and the last post was 2 years ago. Put into perspective, there is a subreddit group called [Michigan Beer](https://www.reddit.com/r/michiganbeer/new/) with 5,000 subscribers and the last post was 10 hours ago

I think that can somehow give us a picture what the startup scene looks like in Michigan

Before sharing my tech startup experience, let me tell a little bit about myself. I am a software developer and moved to Michigan from California a couple of years ago. The reason for moving was for work at that time. I  had experience generating startup ideas, turning it to a product (software, or a mobile app) and running and growing to a sustainable business. I most of the times stay in Oakland County or Ann Arbor area.

&#x200B;

***Let’s start with Smart Zone***

I assume if you are in the startup field in Michigan, you probably heard about [Smart Zone](https://www.michiganbusiness.org/globalassets/documents/reports/fact-sheets/mismartzonefactsheet.pdf) . It is basically a concept that the whole Michigan is divided into 20 areas and each area has a business service center to help ambitious entrepreneurs start or grow their businesses. Some of them even have an incubator program to provide you with some business and financial related seminars..

Ironically, if you are in tech such as software / mobile / internet, you are screwed, because none of these smart zone centers support a legit tech startup. Why? Because their goals are to increase job opportunities and support some native industries such as defense, automotive, mobility things. As a tech startup, you probably want to stay lean as long as possible and will not hire anyone besides paying yourself and your co-founders until you start making good money.

&#x200B;

***Incubator / Accelerator***

Michigan surprisingly has accelerator programs. To name a few:  Desai and Sparks in Ann Arbor, Conquer in Lansing, and TechTown in Detroit

However, from the location, you may already figured these accelerators are tied to universities: U of M is in Ann Arbor, Michigan State University is in Lansing, Wayne State University is in Detroit. These programs are mostly for students in these universities or for their alumina. For other people, it is very hard to get in. Even if you get in, the outcomes will not be as good as you may think (more on this later) Also, to be honest, it is not worth the effort to try to get in when you have other great accelerators out there such as Y Combinator, AngelPad, TechStars which can truly help you grow, build relationship with investors and offer valuable advice.

&#x200B;

***Investors and advisors***

Very straightforward, First, there are not many angel investors who actively look for startups to invest. There are some VC and I guess they gathered money from rich individuals like doctors, lawyers to fund some companies. Accelerators usually play the angel roles, but I got inside information that so many startups in the accelerators were founded by local university students and failed so quickly. Accelerators end up losing money.(That’s why you do not find many accelerators / incubator programs in Michigan, it is a losing-money business and they do not get the return on their investments)

VCs are super conservative, and most of them only invest in automotive, food, real estate, and other traditional business. I know a few who invest in tech company but only limited to enterprise software because Michigan still has the biggest automotive industry with OEMs and Suppliers, their internal software is not good.

If you are making some tech product customers, you will not likely to raise money from VC in Michigan.

Also, there are so many advisors anywhere, they are on the board or this or that startups. They are helpful in their own domains such as legal, finance, etc, but few of them had run startup themselves, so their startup advice doesn’t carry much weight

&#x200B;

***Developers v.s. Entrepreneurs***

There is always a dilemma you need to solve if you want to start a tech startup in Michigan. “Entrepreneurs and developers do not go hand by hand” Most entrepreneurs are non-tech people and most developers are employees without entrepreneurial spirits. For example, in Michigan, most successful entrepreneurs are non-tech business owners ranging from CEO of movie theater franchise to small bakery. Most of them do not care about tech. People in tech are mostly developers who are employed in companies ranging from 5 people studios to giant auto OEMs. Most of them are happy with their paycheck so they will not think about starting a tech startup when they can make money by doing some fairly easy work.

&#x200B;

***Ann Arbor - the tech startup hub***

If you can guess a city that is most related to tech in Michigan, Ann Arbor should be on your top list. There are many good developers I encountered in Ann Arbor. They can code and make something but they lack the entrepreneurial spirits. (You can argue about that, but that was I experienced after talking with hundreds of people) .  Most people in Michigan who get in tech is to get a good paycheck, not to start a company or change the world for better. That’s why there are many coding boot camps or schools such as Grand Circuits. (80% new developers in Detroit will tell you they are somehow associated with Grand Circuits)

Part of the reason why Ann Arbor is tech hub in Michigan is because of U of M, which is ranked very high on any university ranking sites. There is no doubt that the buildings on the campus are beautiful and the interiors are well designed. However, just like most other universities, you do not really learn many practical skills from there even if you are a computer science student. Here is my personal experience. One day, I went to one of the biggest computer labs in the CS building and asked more than 30 students there if they know how to program in Swift ( the programming language used to make native iOS apps), everyone said no. When I got back home and search their curriculum, only one course is related to mobile development. But the statics show more than 75% of people are using mobile phones for personal use compared to 40% using a desktop. So just as most other universities in the US, students are not well trained to stay up to date.

There are many great meetups, one of my favorites is AA New Tech, where every month you can see tech-related startups present their companies, then you can network with presenters. However, although the meetup place is in one of the UM Ann Arbor building, 70% of the audience are over 30 years old and from other cities outside of Ann Arbor. Very few students are in the audience.

So in short, you can say AA is the Tech Hub in Michigan, but no way near compared to Silicon Valley’s standard and hardcore entrepreneurship.

&#x200B;

***Normal people***

I had experience running my own entrepreneurship meetup with 1300+ members in Michigan and personally talked to more than 300 of them. One of the things I found out is the entrepreneurial spirit is lacking. Most people talk and dream, few take actions, very few have the grit to persevere long enough to see some results. I guess it is a big environmental issue. Michigan is a heavily industrial state with the biggest automotive industry. So most people have the industrial worker mentality and are into the Real Estate business. The process looks like this; Graduate university -> Find a decent job in big companies -> buy some mortgages -> Rent them out -> start collecting money and save salary at the same time -> hope to quit a job as soon as possible

With that working employee mentality, few people have the courage to take the leap and start their own tech startup.

&#x200B;

***Conclusion***

If you are hardcore entrepreneur, you can make it happen no matter where you are especially for tech and internet stuff. The only difference is the amount of help and the quality of the help you can get from your surroundings.

In the tech circles in Michigan, business-minded people hardly can find a committed tech co-founder to make a startup take off. Also due to the easiness at the job, most of the developers are not skillful enough to make a great product individually. (If you are skillful, you will not say you are the front or back end developer, you do everything in a tech startup). If they could, they probably will not stay in Michigan.

In my personal opinion, I do not think Michigan is the best place to start a tech startup unless you are doing something closely related to the automotive industry. Even that, you probably will not be able to compete with other tech giants on the west coast. What's new in the automotive industry? I guess self-driving car. Aren’t Google, Tesla, and Uber the lead in the self-driving car industry?

4. My personal purpose for this post is to encourage tech entrepreneurs in Michigan not to give up their startups or even a startup idea so quickly if things get hard. Most often, it may not be your personal problem or your startups'. Keep grinding because the world needs entrepreneurs like you to constantly improve.

***Let’s start***

Before writing this post, I literally searched “Michigan Startups” on Reddit, There is 0 subreddit group result, The closest one is[ Ann Arbor Startups](https://www.reddit.com/r/annarborstartups/) with 22 subscribers and the last post was 2 years ago.

I think that can somehow give us a sense what the startup scene looks like in Michigan

Before sharing my tech startup experience, let me tell you a little bit about myself. I am a software developer and moved to Michigan from California a couple of years ago. The reason for moving was for work at that time. I  had experience generating startup ideas, turning it to a product (software, or a mobile app) and running and growing to a sustainable business. I’m currently running a tech startup. I mostly stay in Oakland County and Ann Arbor area.

Ok, let’s get into the meat.

&#x200B;

***Smart Zone***

I assume if you are in the startup field, no matter tech or non-tech or event small business in Michigan, you probably heard about [Smart Zone](https://www.michiganbusiness.org/globalassets/documents/reports/fact-sheets/mismartzonefactsheet.pdf) .

    The difference between a startup and a small business is the scalability. For example, a local barbarshop can only serve limited amount of people in certain areas, but startups such as early stage Uber or Spanx had the potential to reach people globally

Back to smart zone,  it is basically a concept that the whole Michigan is divided into 20 areas and each area has a business service center to help ambitious entrepreneurs start or grow their businesses. Some of them even have an incubator program to provide some business and financial related seminars, lectures and other related services.

However, if you are in tech such as software / mobile / internet, you are in bad luck, because

1. To get their help especially financially, you have to register your company in certain areas in Michigan and you have to stay there for at least 2-5 years, **which is like a locked contract.** It doesn’t seem like such a big deal.  However, it will not benefit you in the long term if you choose to register in Delaware instead, which has tax advantage and better legal support for businesses
2. **They do not give you cash**. They pay for your non-technical services, such as marketing and legal stuff (note: marketing doesn’t include your Facebook or Google ads, it only pays for marketing agents’ work), Basically, the money they pay will eventually go back to their own people or people who they have connections with. So, if you are not a tech founder, or do not have a tech co-founder in your team. You are screwed because you still need money out of your own pocket to build your product.
3. You have to know the primary goal of the smart zones is to increase job opportunities and support some native industries such as defense, automotive, mobility things. As a tech startup, you probably want to stay lean as long as possible and will not hire anyone besides paying yourself and your co-founders until you start making a good amount of money. So how can you get along with them in a long term? **Different goals!!**

&#x200B;

***Incubator / Accelerator***

It is surprising that Michigan actually has accelerator programs. To name a few:  Desai and Sparks in Ann Arbor, Conquer in Lansing, and TechTown in Detroit

From these locations, you may already figure these accelerators are tied to universities: U of M is in Ann Arbor, Michigan State University is in Lansing, Wayne State University is in Detroit. These programs are mostly for students in these universities or for their alumina. It is hard for outsiders to get in, I personally tried and people who I know have the same experience. So, if you are not connected with these schools somehow, you will probably not get accepted, even if you have a great idea and a working prototype.

Even if you get in the programs, the outcomes will not be as good as you may think (more on this later).  Also, to be honest, it is not worth the effort to try to get in when you have other great accelerators out there such as Y Combinator, AngelPad, and TechStars which can truly help you grow, build strong relationships with investors and offer valuable advice.

&#x200B;

***Investors and advisors***

Very straightforward, **First, there are not many angel investors who actively look for startups to invest.** There are some VCs who I guess gathered money from rich individuals like doctors and lawyers to fund some companies. Accelerators here usually play the angel investors’ roles, but I got insider information that so many startups in the accelerators were founded by local university students and failed so quickly due to many reasons (lack of commitment, bad idea, too small of the market…).

    Personally, I believe doing a startup is a full time job, if you have a good product, you do not have other time than focusing on building and selling your product. You can not go to school / work and run your  startups at same time. That’s probably Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates dropped out of colleges to start their companies.   

So, due to the low quality of the startups they accept, these accelerators end up not getting their investments back.That’s why you do not find many accelerators / incubator programs in Michigan because it is a money-losing business.

VCs are super conservative, and most of them only invest in automotive, food, real estate, and other traditional business. I know a few who invest in tech company but only limited to enterprise software companies because Michigan still has the biggest automotive industry with OEMs and suppliers. Their internal software sucks.

If you are making some tech/digital products for end customers, you will hardly raise money from VC in Michigan. Put in this way, **if Mark Zuckerberg raise money for Facebook in Michigan 12 years ago, he probably won’t get a dime regardless of the bad economy around that time in Michigan.**

Compare to so few angel investors, there are so many advisors who are on the board of many startups. They are helpful in their own domains such as legal, finance, etc, but few of them had ever built/ grown / run a startup themselves, so their startup advice doesn’t carry much weight.

&#x200B;

***Developers v.s. Entrepreneurs***

There is always a dilemma you need to solve if you want to start a tech startup in Michigan. “Entrepreneurs and developers do not go hand by hand.” Most ambitious entrepreneurs have no tech skills and most developers are employees who have no entrepreneurial spirits. For example, in Michigan, most successful entrepreneurs / businessmen/women  are non-tech business owners ranging from CEO of a big franchise movie theater to a small bakery. Most of them do not care about tech. People in tech are mostly developers working at companies ranging from 5 people studios to giant auto OEMs. Most of them are happy with their paycheck so they will not think about starting a tech startup when they can make money by doing some fairly easy work. **So be careful about who you partner with if you can’t do something yourself.**

If you can guess a city that is most related to tech in Michigan, Ann Arbor should be on your top of the list. There are many good developers I encountered in Ann Arbor. They can code and make something but they lack the entrepreneurial spirits as mentioned before.  **Most people in Michigan who get in tech is to get a good paycheck, not to start a company or change the world for better.** That’s why there are many coding boot camps or schools such as Grand Circus. (80% new developers in Detroit will tell you they are somehow associated with Grand Circus, and most of them start coding for the big check).

    If your main goal of starting a tech startups is to make a lot of money, you probably will fail very quickly, because money is just not a big enough motivation to push your through startup hardships. 

Part of the reason why Ann Arbor is tech hub in Michigan is because of U of M, which is ranked very high on any university ranking sites. There is no doubt that the school spends a lot of money on their buildings exteriors and interiors to attract students. However, just like most other universities, you do not really learn many practical skills from there even if you are a computer science student. Here is my personal experience. One day, I went to one of the biggest computer labs in the CS building and asked more than 30 students there if they know how to program in Swift ( the programming language used to make native iOS apps), everyone said no. When I got back home and search their curriculum, only one course is related to mobile development. However, stats show more than 75% of people are using mobile phones for personal use compared to 40% using a desktop. So just as most other universities in the US, students are not well trained to stay up to date.

There are many great meetups, one of my favorites is AA New Tech, where every month you can see tech-related startups present their companies, then you can network with presenters. However, although the meetup place is in one of the UM Ann Arbor building, 70% of the audience are over 30 years old and from other cities outside of Ann Arbor. Very few students are in the audience. Students are not well involved in the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Ann Arbor

    I feel for universities to teach entrepreneurship is like for Chipotle to sell Pizza. Because the initial purpose of public education is to train people for work, not to start a company. Even that, current universities obviously failed both ways. First, we are no longer in a industrial era and we do not need a lot of workers / employees (more than 50% of people currently are self-employeed or freelancers in the gig economy era). . Second, even if the purpose to train workers holds true, universities sill do not teach practical skills needed to perform at a job. 

So in short, you can say AA is the Tech Hub in Michigan, but no way near compared to Silicon Valley’s standard and hardcore entrepreneurship.

&#x200B;

***Common people***

I had experience running my own entrepreneurship meetup with 1300+ members in Michigan and personally talked to more than 300 of them. One of the things I found out is the entrepreneurial spirit is seriously lacking. **Most people talk a lot, few of them take actions, and very few have the grit to persevere long enough to see some results.** I guess it is a big environmental issue. Michigan is a heavily industrial state with the biggest automotive industry. So most people have the industrial worker mentality and are more interested in the traditional Real Estate business. The process looks like this; Graduate university -> Find a decent job in big companies -> Buy some mortgages -> Rent them out -> Start collecting money and save salary at the same time -> Hope to get enough money to quit a job as soon as possible

With that working employee mentality, few people have the courage to take the leap and start their own tech startup.

&#x200B;

***Bonus: what’s the best business to start in Michigan***

After observing businesses around the lower side of Michigan, you will more likely succeed if you start the following business

1. Small food joints or food trucks: because
   1. People here love food to a different level. There is countless time I see many of my friends getting ready for 2 hours, driving for 30 plus minutes and waiting for 1 hour to dine in a popular restaurant in Detroit. Not even mention I saw people post on Facebook that they waited for 2 hours in a line for some free BBQ in a food festival. (yes, there are multiple food festivals in Michigan around the year.)
   2. There is not much to do in Michigan especially during the 6+ months of winter. I guess that’s why delicious food at a local restaurants become one of the best options.
   3. You can get investment and the odds are pretty high. Quick story, this summer June 22, there was a big Small Business / Startups pitch competition called  [Quicken Loans Detroit Dem Day](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/quicken-loans-detroit-demo-day-tickets-44344603904#) where 15 entrepreneurs pitched their companies to win over 1 million dollar investment, These 15 companies are categorized into 3 different groups based on the age of the company. Each group has a tech-related startup. Guess what was the result? All 3 winners are in the food industry, Popcorn stores, bakery store, and frozen fruit plant. Did I say the last year winner was a cupcake store in Detroit too?
   4. If you keep the size small, such as selling at the farmers market at the beginning, you can make a decent amount of money and not need to worry about the operation stuff.
2. Coffee shops near universities
   1. Almost every coffee shops around college campus are full if not packed. Regardless of the taste of the coffee or whatever you are selling. If you have a cozy environment and a high-speed wifi. You are good to go.
   2. Just be careful about the revenue drop during the summer break. Even that, your business  is still in a great shape
3. More….(you may know some too, leave your recommended business to start in Michigan)

&#x200B;

***Conclusion:***

**If you are a hardcore entrepreneur, you can make it happen no matter where you are especially for tech and internet stuff.** The only difference is the amount of help and the quality of the help you can get from your surroundings.

In my personal opinion, I do not think Michigan is the best place to start a tech startup unless you are doing something closely related to the automotive industry. Even that, you probably will not be able to compete with other tech giants on the west coast. What's new in the automotive industry? I guess self-driving car. Aren’t Google, Tesla, and Uber the leaders in the self-driving car industry?

Even Paul Graham (founder of Y-Combinator) said in his blog “ [The 18 Mistakes That Kill Startups](http://www.paulgraham.com/startupmistakes.html)“ The number 2 mistake is the Wrong Location. In his words,

&#x200B;

>""Startups prosper in some places and not others. Silicon Valley dominates, then Boston, then Seattle, Austin, Denver, and New York. After that there's not much. Even in New York the number of startups per capita is probably a 20th of what it is in Silicon Valley. In towns like Houston and Chicago and Detroit it's too small to measure…  
>  
>…Who knows exactly how these factors combine to boost startups in Silicon Valley and squish them in Detroit, but it's clear they do from the number of startups per capita in each.”

aevpm0,EVs will kill the Alaskan Economy by 2030,"So I've brought my position on this to basically every other media platform. I can't be the only one that see this.

Electric vehicles are here to stay. They will only continue to gain popularity as technology matches pace.

As they become accepted demand for internal Combustion Engines will cease.

80% of our states budget is run off of oil money. 50% of all oil consumption is in fuel for vehicles.

The slope survives, it'll cut all unnecessary labor. How secure is your job? Will you be replaced by a self driving electric semi? Do you watch valves all day? Something a computer could do better? Can you be replaced by a program? Well you'll be the first to go. On top of that you won't have the job skills to survive in the new economy. You'll be as obsolete as a flip phone

First solution is tax other industries more evenly as discussed in this article from 2014... 2014 people.

https://www.adn.com/voices/article/alaskas-lopsided-tax-rates-unfair-everyone/2014/12/31/

After that we need to invite new industry. I personally think manufacturing is the way to go. I mean as well as funding education. Look at China's economy. We're the closest state geographically to Asia. Made in America still means something. Asia, especially the island nation's are currently the fastest growing economies in the world. They're populations are experiencing wealth they've never known. And they're buying things.

Transportation has typically been the limiting factor for America. By approaching the Asian markets it's our strength. On top of that we mine most natural resources and have a literal abundance of space. 

Hell a corporation could buy enough land to build a metropolis. Probably for under a million. You could build a city around efficienct production. 

Idk I know I'm not crazy, maybe manufacturing isn't the solution but we need to start the discussion. The sooner we come together and start working towards a solution the better chance we have at not becoming the next West Virginia after the coal industry died. 

Just look at the trends. Good luck finding a used Tesla the demand is so high. On top of that they are outselling import ICE vehicles. We probably don't actually have until 2030, the demand for oil will continue to drop.

Edit: I have been asked how we power it. I like the idea of tidal energy

b9qb28,"Traveling from San Fran (or Carmel) to Los Angeles by car over 2 week period, advice, suggestions appreciated, is family vacation","Hi, we've never been to California and this May we'll be flying into SFO, staying for 2 nights there (don't think we need a car in SFO), and then planning to rent a car (or other recommended form of transportation? - to get to Carmel).

We have family in Carmel, so will be staying there with them and can use that as a home base while we do day trips all around the area, we don't mind driving an hour or two each day or even three hours total if it's worth it. 

Then after about 5 nights in Carmel we'll drive down the Pacific coast highway stopping at Big Sur and San Luis Obispo (or other stops) for a night or 2. We'll then continue to make our way to Los Angeles and stay there for 5 nights or so (family there, so we'll use it as a home base while we take day trips). 

Do you guys have suggestions on how I should handle/sort car rental? I'm not sure whether I need to rent in San Francisco or just start the rental in Carmel and take train or something down to Carmel because I don't think I need one while I'm in San Francisco..I thought about doing a Tesla Turo rental for a day or 2 (kids would love that) maybe when we're in 1 place (like Carmel) because I'm sure renting that from 1 location and dropping off further south would be difficult / way more expensive with a Turo rental..

Also any other highlights to hit up between Carmel and Los Angeles? We will have kids less than 9 years old with us, and we want to make memories for them, this is a family vacation for the kids. We have availability to stay a night or two to really check things out in that beautiful stretch of California between those two cities..

bcl9hx,Minnesota Farmer pissed about Anti-Right to Repair Lobbying," As a hops farmer, I rely on heavy equipment to grow the hops that make beer delicious. I pay a lot for that equipment, but it turns out that the manufacturers don't think farmers like me should be allowed to fix it ourselves. They use software locks and other gimmicks to make certain repairs only possible through authorized dealers, which can be inconvenient and overly expensive. 

Right to Repair, currently on tap in the Legislature (H.F. 1138/S.F. 1077), would break up that monopoly on certain repairs.

In the House hearings, the authorized ag equipment dealers claimed that people like me cannot be allowed to have access to the tools, manuals, parts and diagnostic software necessary to fix my equipment because we would use those tools to circumvent environmental controls and illegally pollute. 

I am proud that I grow my hops the right way. I am not a latent criminal polluter just waiting for the right tools to make my tractors and other equipment break the law. Some advice to those ag dealers and the manufacturers they represent: Stop calling your customers criminals and respect our right to fix the equipment we bought and paid for.

bn4k82,"I love this place, but I'm about ready to leave","I've lived in Virginia, off and on, for about 10 years. During that time, I've lived in Fairfax, James City, and Henrico counties, and the City of Richmond. This state is beautiful in a lot of ways—the mountains, the rivers, the beaches, the grassy plains, the forests. There's something for everyone here. 


I currently live in Henrico County. My job requires me to travel all over the state. I go everywhere. I mean *everywhere.* I have driven windy backroads to Hurley and Kilmarnock and South Boston and Independence. I have seen the sun come up over the glittering glass towers of Rosslyn and Crystal City and Tysons Corner. I have walked the boardwalk at Virginia Beach. I have seen the decay of Portsmouth and Pennington Gap, of Hampton and Haysi. I've driven the length of every road that ends in -60. I have seen rebel battle flags and hate has no home here signs, rusted old Dodge pickups and shiny Teslas. I know a dozen suburban sprawls by heart—Jefferson Avenue, Little River Turnpike, Hull Street, Seminole Trail, Virginia Beach Boulevard, Leesburg Pike. I have felt the sand between my toes at waterfronts near Deltaville and Chincoteague and Colonial Beach. I have stood before colossal mansions in the hills beyond NoVA and in the hilly streets of Arlington, where the wealthy pass their days. I have stood before dilapidated shacks in the ruins of coal country, among piles of rusted metal and old garbage and broken-down appliances. This state represents, basically, the entirety of the American experience, from ultra-poverty through stratospheric wealth.


All of this is to say that I feel like I have some insight into the present condition of our Commonwealth, and that our legislators have, and continue to, fail us. They fail us every time we drive on I-95 through Fairfax, Prince William, and Stafford counties, where the land available for expanding the interstate was instead given to private corporations to charge outrageous tolls, and massive backups are an inescapable reality for millions of people. They fail us when we drive between massive tractor trailers on I-81, where speeds don't seem to get above about 55 mph and there's no margin for error. They fail us when we wait to pass through the bridge tunnels in Hampton Roads. They fail us when we sit and wait for what feels like hours, inching forward along two-lane, shoulderless roads in suburban and exurban counties because of a single traffic signal way down the line. Good god the roads in this state are terrible. I have lived in New York, California, and other large states, and none of them—not even New York—have roads anywhere near as bad as the roads here in Virginia. Why don't the legislators do what it takes to raise revenue to fix this mess? I-95 and I-81 should look like the northern half of the New Jersey Turnpike. There should be a lot more in the way of commuter rail. Metro should be expanded. No more selling the available land to private corporations that can charge exorbitant rates.  Raise taxes and implement tolls on I-81, especially for vehicles with more than two axles—what are they going to do? Go around Virginia? It's quaint how legislators at the local and state level continue to refer to places like Stafford and Prince William counties as “rural.” They're not. They haven't been rural in years. They are not going to become rural. Virginia needs to get with the program and start treating infrastructure as a priority. Our elected leaders need to stop pretending like Virginia is some quiet agrarian paradise and not a place where the majority of people live in densely-populated cities and suburbs (this isn't to say that there isn't a lot of beautiful rural countryside in Virginia—there is; it's just that most of the people and economic activity are concentrated in NoVA, RVA, Hampton Roads, and the counties between those three regions).

buzbml,Going Solar in AZ?,"Hello, I got a proposal from Tesla / Solar City about 1.5 years ago that got delayed due to roof repairs. Those have been taken care of and now I need to decide whether or not to move forward. I have a 10kw system proposed for around $30k - with an estimated 80% offset.  I have heard that the AZ power companies like APS have really reduced their rates they buy electricity and implemented other tactics that make solar far less attractive. I could add a power wall and  go 100% off the grid BUT I don't think the ROI stacks up there. Additionally, there has been a lot of negative PR about Telsa and their solar program. Does anyone have a recent (2019) experience with them- particularly in AZ who can give me some pointers?

bzgouu,WA State's Absurd Electric Car Penalty,"You have to love the Democrats who run the state. They talk the eco-talk, and then turn right around and penalize electric cars. Money always beats principles with the ""progressives.""

Before I go through the details, I will say this: As the owner of an EV (used, and not some $100,000+ Tesla, so there was never a sales tax exemption involved), I think all road vehicles should be registered, display a plate, and pay taxes to use the roads. Including bicycles. No free rides, and no special privileges. So I'm in favor of tax on the electricity that EVs use. But that tax should be equivalent to the gas tax. WA State's EV fee is laughably (well, not so laughably) high and completely unfair.

**Let's start with the gasoline tax**, which in WA State is 67.8 cents/gallon. A bit more than a quarter of that (18.4 cents) goes to the feds. The other 49.4 cents goes to Olympia for highway maintenance. There is a built-in fuel economy incentive; the less gas you buy, the less tax you pay. Oh, and something else: 99% of all vehicle-caused pavement damage is done by semitrucks and buses. No matter how much they weigh, cars and light trucks do essentially no pavement damage. A final tidbit: The average gas car is driven 13,500 miles a year. The average small car in the U.S. gets 28 miles to the gallon; uses 485 gallons of gas; and in WA State would pay $240 to Olympia in gas taxes, or 1.8 cents/mile.

**Now let's take EVs.** Olympia's fee is $150 a year, regardless of which EV or how far it's driven. The average EV gets the equivalent of about 105 miles to the gallon, derived by stating the energy content of electricity in gasoline terms and then doing the standard MPG arithmetic. The average EV is driven 9,000 miles a year, which makes sense because EVs lack the range that gas cars have.

For the mythical average EV, the equitable tax would be 9,000 miles driven divided by 105 equivalent miles per gallon, times 49.4 cents, or $43. If Olympia wants to collect another 18.4 cents/gallon for the feds and send it to them, it would be $58 a year. Last time I looked, Olympia wasn't sending one-quarter of that $150 EV fee to the other Washington. God forbid; you get between Olympia's ""progressives"" and a tax with the same likelihood of success as getting between a bear sow and her cubs.

**What if you're not ""average?""** I have a dinky little plastic ""Think City"" EV. I keep detailed records of every charge, and its fuel consumption and fuel economy. In the past year, my EV got 123 MPG-e. I drove it 3,073 miles: basically for grocery runs and other local errands. Its gasoline equivalent is the Scion iQ, a microcar of almost exactly the same shape, dimensions, and weight. The Scion gets 37 MPG. In the past year, my EV has consumed $82 worth of electricity. Its fuel cost was 2.7 cents/mile. The Scion's fuel cost for the same miles driven, without the gas tax, would have been 7 cents a mile. State gas tax would have added 1.3 cents a mile.

If I owned a Scion and not the EV, I'd have paid Olympia $39 in gas tax. If I were charged according to fuel economy for the EV, which is how it works with gas cars, the state gas tax replacement fee would be $12. If they ignored the greater fuel economy, I'd have paid $39. But the eco-talking, climate-change lecturing ""progressive"" hypocrites who run this state charged me $150, or 4.9 cents a mile. This almost quadruple what they'd get if I drove a gas-powered Scion, and more than 12x what they'd get if they incentivized fuel economy for EVs the same way that they do for other vehicles. Mind you, these are the very same fakers who constantly lecture us about ""carbon output.""

**But there's no gas pump, so you can't pay taxes the same way**. True. You can pay them a different way: You can simply report your mileage when you renew your registration, and add the correct fee. Would people cheat? I doubt it, but if Olympia is worried about that, then have the EV owner drive his vehicle to a designated spot (as long as it's close enough, because of that range thing) so someone else can look at the odometer and issue a little piece of paper to be included with the renewal. Again: I don't want a subsidy. Only equal treatment, on the same basis.

**Another tidbit. The Democrats tried to raise the annual EV fee to $350 in the last legislative session**. Fortunately, that was batted down. But it tells you just how greedy, hypocritical, and dishonest these ""eco talking"" phonies who run Washington State really are.",Washington,https://www.reddit.com/r/Washington/comments/bzgouu/wa_states_absurd_electric_car_penalty/,6/11/2019 19:03,0,11,washington

cmegul,Lets talk about some of the smaller California city and region subreddits.,"----

----

There are a few California subs that have more users than /r/California, including /r/SanFrancisco (128,125), /r/BayArea (138,214), and /r/LosAngeles (155,305). **But there are also quite a few smaller subs with thousands of subscribers**. I invite you to check them out, subscribe, comment, and post interesting links and discussions to these local subs.

I spent some of this last weekend looking at many of those subs using this Wiki page listing most of the California-based subs as a guide:

http://www.reddit.com/r/California/wiki/faq

I did some new editing of that page, but that page still needs some more updating if anyone wants to volunteer. A big problem is that list was created from someone else's list. It now needs some major recategorization. :( 

If someone knows the Bay Area and/or the Central Valley better than I do, your help would be greatly appreciated. And if there's just one sub you think needs to be added, anyone who's been an active participant in /r/California should be able to edit that Wiki page.

Also, as sort of a reality check I posted a bunch of old USGS topo/combo maps to many of the subs because old maps are usually pretty popular. Even [the map](https://www.reddit.com/r/imperialvalley/comments/cm3eqq/1908_topo_map_salton_sink/) posted to the tiny /r/imperialvalley sub (184 users) got 10 upvotes. 

I used this online map collection:

http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/topo/california/

Did you know there used to be a town named Tesla in California?

I may have missed a few of the more active cities, so just leave a comment.

It was interesting to see some of the topics that were pretty common in many of the subs: sunset photos, lost/found/stolen dogs/cats/cars/bikes, what is that police activity/helicopter/loud noise/smell, where's the best place for tacos/shaves/hairstyling, all the normal touristy questions, what is there for locals to do, XYZ restaurant just opened/closed, best internet company, best cellphone company, etc.

d8mnhf,GMP's Tesla Powerwall program - my experience,"TL;DR: Can't imagine ratepayers are getting their money's worth, but participants do.

GMP installed two Tesla Powerwalls in my basement in the middle of July.  My cost was $3000.  This is through the Resilient Home program, where they heavily subsidize these and other storage devices in exchange for access to the stored power during times of peak demand.

There's been a few little blips of power outages since then.  I'm at the end of a dirt road, low priority - and I only know of the outages from the App reporting them.  

Since then GMP has only drawn 180KwH from my batteries.  It's been two months, with some awfully hot days in there.  28KwH capacity between the two of them.  So less than 7 cycles of the system.  

I'm grateful for it, as it's a hell of a lot cheaper than a generator, and in my efficient new home with some rationing, in my testing (just throw the breaker to the grid) I'll get a good 4 days of backup power if needed.  

Recent news called in to question the benefits for all ratepayers vs participants.  I'd like to see some real math by an independent nongovernmental third party demonstrating the conditions and utilization rates under which
this program is benefitting all ratepayers, how long it takes, and with excruciating detail on the assumptions.

hj25rd,Solar Panel Installers in Oklahoma,"Do you have residential solar panels installed in Oklahoma? Who installed your system?

It seems that Net-metering has finally been adopted in Oklahoma, making residential solar power reasonable. I got three quotes this week; Sunpro, Shine Solar, and Solar Power of Oklahoma (SPO).

SPO quoted a 12kw system that would be maybe $20-$50/month (15 yr vs. 20 yr loan) more than my average OG&E bill. This should cover 80-90% of my electricity use. The other two companies were so far off on price they almost seem like a scam.

I got serious about looking at solar because I saw Tesla lowered their solar panel prices, but they do not currently install in Oklahoma. It is very cruel of them to advertise their price and yet not give an estimated date for offering service in Oklahoma.

Comparing Tesla's quote to SPO leaves me anxious because Tesla is so much cheaper. I fear that Tesla will not offer service in Oklahoma until after the 26% federal tax credit expires, in which case it would be a wash and I could have already been benefiting from solar for 1-2 years.

2. His neglectful actions have demonstrated that he is comfortable with hundreds of thousands of K-12 kids spending their days in buildings that desperately need seismic upgrades (or security upgrades) while State buildings get plenty of cosmetic upgrades.
3. He has plundered so much cash from Utah's kids that Utah's ""rainy day fund"" grows by hundreds of millions of dollars each year and sometimes passes the $1 billion dollar  mark. This cash often disappears without audit. Uneducated adult Utahn's claim that Utah's education funding is so low because Utah has ""so many kids"" and people don't want to pay high taxes for education but in this they leave out that people are dumb enough to pay taxes that contribute to this annual surplus. Educated Utahan's often refer to this paradox as ""The Utah Vote"".
4. The cost of the new Salt Lake  airport has increased from a staggering $2 billion to almost $4 billion in just a few years. This means the cost has gone up by more than $1.2 Million dollars A DAY every day since construction started and the cost is still rising. The cost of Utah's new state prison is $650 million taxpayer dollars and also still rising. Other states are building prisons for half  that. Herbert has yet to suggest audits to bring transparency to the public for these daunting and unexplained costs to taxpayers.
5. Herbert's neglectful actions provided hundreds of thousands of Utah taxpayer dollars to be spent as start up funds for an online business named ""Homie"" who's goal is to put 8,000-10,000 Utahn's out of work. Herbert's GOED offices tries desperately to keep this a secret.
6. Herbert is comfortable with Salt Lake, Utah, Weber and Logan county's toxic air getting exponentially worse as thousands of ""micro"" apartments are being built in these areas every month. There are already 30 toxic red air days a year. What will happen to property values as that number continues to increase?  These high mountain valley bowls don't have vast oceans  for toxins to dissipate over like the ""big"" cities around the country do. Kid's are especially vulnerable to the toxins in the air. How many sleepless nights lying next to their poisoned and coughing children will Utah parents tolerate at Herbert's hands?
7. Herbert prevented clean air vehicle manufacturers like Tesla from being able to sell their vehicles directly to Utahns for years even with  the high pollution levels as shameful as they already are.
8. Herbert continues to allow certain Utah companies  to fill Utah's air with toxins at night while Utahns sleep instead of  doing it during the day when might could see it happening.
9. Herbert continues to push the Inland Port Project to be located in Salt Lake valley. This means every hour of  every day hundreds of additional diesel cargo truck engines will be pumping  toxin heavy particulate exhaust from low quality diesel fuel into Salt  Lake Valley's already toxic air as they constantly move thousands of containers  from around. Utah, Ogden and Logan valley's are sure to see  their portion of this increase in toxins as well. (Yes breathing non-poisonous air is important to some Utahans, especially those who love their kids).
10. Regardless of what is claimed about security capabilities, the  Inland Port will exponentially increase the risk of a catastrophic attack event for millions of Utahns. Dirty bombs and other mass casualty weapons are  a reality that governments should be aware of and do everything they  can to ensure residents safety against. The sobering reality of the  possibility of this is something people just shouldn't have to consider  when evaluating where to raise their family. For the two million people  in Salt Lake, Utah and Weber counties this anxiety is a new reality unless this is reversed.
11. Herbert single handedly evicted Salt Lake City's long time ""Outdoor Retailer Convention"". No longer hosting this  lucrative convention costs Salt Lake City and it's residents nearly $75 million in lost revenue each year.
12. Herbert has demonstrated that he is comfortable ignoring Utah's hemorrhaging homelessness problem. Solutions are readily available yet the circumstances have been allowed to become so shameful that on average, every 72 hours a desperate homeless person feebly slips out of this life ignored and painfully neglected while within arms reach on Utah's streets. This means more than 100 corpses are found on Salt Lake Cities streets each year. The same street's that Mormon, Inc's. hundreds of vacant ""chapels"" and other properties occupy.
13. The Office of the Attorney General has been suddenly vacated twice during his tenure. Even after  Mark Shurtleff's forceful resignation, he still appointed  Shurtleff's lieutenant John Swallow to be Utah's next Attorney General.  Swallow was then forced to resign within a matter of months while Herbert  quietly looked the other way yet again. Both men pointed fingers at each  other and others yet were cleared of initial charges in peculiar court circumstances riddled with legal loopholes and surprises that included a  jailed internet millionaire, a suspected ponzi scheme con-artist,  private jets, resort visits and other peculiar incidents and characters.
14. He has allowed so many  loopholes in Utah's Civilian Semi-Automatic Weapon laws that anyone from  anywhere can acquire Civilian Semi-Automatic Weapons, ammunition and  tactical gear in internet initiated, stranger to stranger, cash or trade  meet ups that only take a moment to complete. This real world scenario  happens countless times a day in Utah. It is a carnival of horrors and  we have allowed Gary R. Herbert to make it our reality.
15. Many of Utah's police  departments have gone extended periods without the protective bulletproof vests, tactical  gear and other equipment they desperately need and deserve even though there is plenty of excess taxpayer money available to pay for it and even though almost every house in Utah has an AR-15 and cases upon cases of ammo.
16. Herbert has allowed a private corporation named ""Utah State Bar"" to be an [i](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/hhlt7x/in_the_state_with_the_highest_rates_of_suicide/)mposter and pose as a legitimate State office. This contributes to Utah's attorneys being unsupervised by the State. These 6,500 attorneys are allowed to bring tragedy and destruction to the lives of more than 10,000 Utahans a year as they secretly groom them and exploit hundreds of millions of dollars from them.

&#x200B;

\*Update July 6, 2020 -Herbert was Huntsman's lieutenant governor nearly 12 years ago. Herbert became governor when Huntsman accepted a sudden assignment to be the US ambassador to China. At the time, Herbert chose 34 year old Cox to be his lieutenant governor. When Herbert announced his retirement after 12 years, Huntsman decided to run for governor again in 2020. Instead of endorsing Huntsman, [puppet Herbert endorsed puppet Cox](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/us/politics/spencer-cox-jon-huntsman-utah.html). This should lead to some interesting twists and turns as the corruption and fraud within Herbert/Cox's office, Mormon controlled Utah and Mormonism continue to be exposed.

Excerpt:

>The fifth-richest person in the world, who already owns most of the homes on Hawaii’s sixth-largest island, plans to build an unusual group of new residences on Lanai...A company affiliated with tech billionaire Larry Ellison intends to develop five estates on roughly 2-acre coastal lots once intended for sale as custom vacation homesites in the Manele resort area...

>According to plans submitted to the Maui County Urban Design Review Board, all the homes feature detached three-car garages containing a stairway and an industrial elevator that connect to extensive basements in each home via a subterranean passageway.   Each home also includes a separate utility building of at least 1,000 square feet with emergency backup battery power, a backup diesel generator, propane storage and a trash room.

- - - -

Gee, do ya think this will inspire Zuckerberg to up the size of his planned housing on his Kauai property?  Zuckerberg only owns 750 acres (two parcels: 357-acres and  393-acres). 

Ellison owns 98% percent of Lanai, which is some 90,000 acres. 

Quite an imbalance between these two moguls as to their land acquisition in Hawaii.  If it wasn't for the native Hawaiians on Molokai, Zuckerberg would probably be eying that island for major land purchases.

For the electric vehicle owner, the **$200 fee is over twice** what is paid by the 30mpg car driver in gas taxes. It's the equivalent of a car that gets 14-15mpg. 

It's completely reasonable to ask electric car owners to pay an electric vehicle fee to replace the gas tax; every roadway user needs to contribute. But this price gap is regressive.

iz8cb9,Just throwing this out there,"If I were to run for Governor of Ohio, This is what I would do within the first year of office;

**Legalize Cannabis & Drug Reform**

⦁	I would tax it and have that revenue be put 50% towards Schools (65% to inner city and 35% to rural) and the other 50% into infrastructure.

⦁	I would release all non-violent offenders for cannabis and have those charges expunged.

⦁	I would make it legal to grow as many plants as you want while making business licenses easy to obtain for those who wish to be an entrepreneur.

⦁	All non-violent drug charges will be lowered to a fine. The Fine would be waived upon successful completion of rehab and time being sober.

**Gun Control & Police Reform**

⦁	To own a firearm you would need to have a minimum of 100 documented hours of live firearm training as well as pass a mental and criminal background check. Once this is complete, you will receive a card until we can put it on your driver license.

⦁	To carry a conceded firearm you would need 1000 documented hours of live firearm training. As well as 1000 documented hours of tactical training in both defense and live firearm training.

⦁	Mandatory live firearm training at certified facilities (current gun ranges) at least one day a month after obtaining said license's. (Well-regulated militia)

⦁	Revenue from these licenses will go to better Police training in both live firearm training and conflict resolution skills to de-escalate situations and into bettering hiring practices. The Police officers will then have free choice to not arrest someone if they feel the person is not a threat to public safety. All abusers of this will be thoroughly investigated and terminated immediately.


(No, I don't want to make it harder for law abiding citizens to get firearms, infact, I'd love to make it easier and safer. I along with everyone else so far just want people trained and trained properly. So how do we do it?)


**Jobs & Taxes**

⦁	I would try to work with major companies like Tesla, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Sony America and many more to bring well paying manufacturing and tech jobs into Ohio.

⦁	I would to try to follow Texas and cut a lot of taxes on companies and employees. As well as help out a lot of ""Mom & Pop"" shops.

⦁	I would eliminate all sales tax on essential items like food, formula, diapers, medicine, personal hygiene products, etc. (if applicable)

jne2d7,Vtel Wireless and the rise of Starlink,"**TL;DR - Starlink internet should provide a solid alternative to those using costly 4G providers or other satellite services.**

I'm hoping this post is helpful for those in similar situations such as myself. I have been struggling to find acceptable work-from-home internet providers here in the Northeast Kingdom of VT for 5 years now.

Currently, I am subscribed to VTEL Wireless - a 4G internet provider out of Springfield. My experience with 4G service has been extremely lackluster. We have had countless outages, equipment replacements, and their support is extraordinarily lacking. Recently, they redacted support for my account, stating that they never should have installed the tower in my location, due to poor reception.

I could go on, but this post is really more to encourage those not to lose hope.

Elon Musk, the brain behind SpaceX and Tesla, has recently launched Starlink, a low-orbit satellite broadband service that is currently in Beta testing. Service should become available to Vermonters later this month.

The current beta testers are seeing download speeds of 100-200Mbps, with an average ping/latency of 29ms. My current speed with VTEL Wireless? 3Mbps, with an average latency of 100ms...

I believe the going rate will be $500 for the antenna, and then $90/mo for the service, which is unlimited (no download/upload limits). This may seem like a lot to those with access to Cable or Fiber internet providers, but from my perspective, I paid $800 for the VTEL Wireless tower, and I am currently paying $130/mo for the service, which is limited to 500GB of data transfer per month.

I am not affiliated with Starlink in any way, I just heavily support this type of infrastructure development.

I'm less concerned about a ROI than about being a good dirty-hippie and lowering carbon consumption (especially since much of the power in WI is produced using coal, still).  

Has anyone worked with local contractors that they can recommend?  I'll likely be doing some kind of battery system to augment it.  I'm less interested in putting power back into the grid (since there's minimal Finacial incentive to do it here), and I'd rather store it to run AC and heat water overnight.",wisconsin,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/jnfpm1/anyone_done_solar_panels_on_their_house/,11/3/2020 18:23,30,24,wisconsin

I realize it will interfere with your daily life and make it difficult if you have to give up your apple devices and Tesla products but you're nothing but a hypocrite if you attack the Oil companies and Timber industry and say and do nothing about the others that have become 100x worse!



So Apple mostly uses cheap labor, rapes the planet using heavy metals for their batteries and other components and uses tons of packaging. Telsa just rapes the planet for heavy metal for their batteries and also supports companies that use child labor to extract the metal for the batteries and other electronics in their cars. 


So where is your outrage? phh... you're all disgusting and just outright worthless people. At least oil companies and timber companies pay excellent wages to their employees.

Maybe some tax break for the ones going green not an extra tax? 

Who here owns an EV? Have you actually saved money by switching or did all the new taxes take what you saved?

The Tesla was a big splurge for me but I figured in the long term, it was a good investment - the battery will last 300k miles, and Musk is claiming the cars will last 1 million miles.

Now, I’ve been informed that it’s roughly $4.50 per 100 dollars... 60,000/100= 600 x 4.5 = 2700. BUT that you have to pay it twice per year, so that is $5,400. Per year. For a car you already own.

We've listened to the sales pitch, and are supposed to have a ""site evaluation"" done tomorrow. But we are looking to see if anyone has done this, and has had an actual good outcome. All I've heard is ""don't do it""  Reasons ranging from the panels damaging the roof. To not enough savings. To huge tax implications. And  ""If you refi. Or are looking for a home equity loan, you're gonna get screwed because they put a lien on your house.""

The only ""savings"" I have heard them mention comes to about $42. And I am not altruistic enough to put solar on my house for a difference of under $50 a month. Yes, I know that adds up.

oc00ta,"EV street charging in idaho - want to buy an electric vehicle, but can I charge it in front of my house?","This is a going to be a bit specific, likely narrow audience today - but not in a few years when the cheaper EVs hit the market, and they have become a better value for most (not all) day to day average drivers.  Thanks in advance.

I would like to make my next car electric.  I own my Northend house, but I don't have space to park on my alley - which means I can't really charge at home, where it's better in numerous ways (more convenient, cheaper, better for the battery using slower charge rates, etc).  Incidentally, this is the same problem many renters face, and is a big barrier to large-scale EV adoption.

My idea is to put a charger (or just a dedicated 240 circuit + ""mobile"" charger) in the easement.

I wouldn't be guaranteed to ""have"" ""my"" spot (it's a public street) but parking pressure is low and I only drive a few times a week.  So this wouldn't be a problem practically speaking.  I've only managed to find a single instance of this online (not in idaho) - although in that case the owner got permit for a 2-year 'trial' AND was allowing the public access to the charger, for free.

ol5psr,Solar in Arizona with SRP - Why does everyone spec 40-60% capacity? Is anyone oversizing 80%+?,"I am currently shopping around for local solar providers to provide coverage for an SRP household. I've spoken to a few but I am still in the early stages of the process - research, quoting, review, etc.

What I've noticed thus far is due to SRP's poor payment model for gained energy (something like 2.8 per kwh) installers state that the best ROI is 40-60% of energy capacity.

Speaking to a friend of mine who was also researching a while ago he stated that the reason was due to off-peak energy being fairly inexpensive that it did not make much sense to spend a lot of money on hardware beyond the on-peak needs.

I am aware that SRP adds in a bunch of fees and surcharges for running solar, but my intent is to minimize the bill even if that means oversizing the system.

Tesla was my first thought, mostly because of their power walls. However, after reading some reviews I am considering a local installer with local support. Some offer batteries some do not. Difficult to choose which to go with as there are various options which panels, micro inverters, batteries, etc. I'd like to have a transfer switch to allow the house to run during blackout periods (no less than 4 hours on a full household load, but no greater than 24 hours). It's a fairly wide range and I haven't dug in with any resellers yet.

What I'd like to know is this: Is anyone running an oversized solar system which covers 80%+ of power demand? If so, I presume batteries are used to store excess energy? And last, if that's the case is anyone using an intelligent transfer switch which is switching to battery power for a short period of time in the event the solar generation isn't enough to cover the demand of the household during peak hours (running solar generation + battery reserve)?

For reference: Tesla's online calculator estimated 4 power walls + 16kwh system roughly $62k before tax.

Thanks!

&#x200B;

Edit: I ended up going with Aneva solar. System will go in place sometime later this year. System is 17kW which is decent. They're using the newer LG 380W panels. I'll update once they do the install, but the customer experience thus far has been positive. Very responsive to inquiries. While they offer battery options, they discourage people due to ROI, but will install if requested - however, they noted that they expect battery tech to become a more attractive option soon.

2. What was delivery like? Easy ship-to-door or pick up at either Kawaihae or Hilo?
3. Was the estimated delivery accurate? I know some things take longer to arrive for Hawaii.
4. Any regrets choosing the certain model you have? Wished you would have gotten another telsa model or trim level? For ex: getting the longer range AWD rather than the short range 2WD
5. Experiences driving around BI and finding public chargers.
6. How is maintenance and addressing any issues that come up with your Tesla? I believe Tesla has a mobile mechanic/technician on BI.

Any experiences would be appreciated so I can have an idea of what to expect!

qtdfby,Cat’s Paw - Portland,"Before I tell you about this place, I need to establish my credentials on the topic of drinking establishments. I’ve been around the world twice as a US Marine and more times than I can count as a consultant.  I’ve drank in back alley bars in Mexico that serve beer for a quarter but antibiotics for $100. Smokey bars in Romania where the spirit of Stalin still whispers you gently to the gulag. Dance clubs in Thailand where the bass music simply reverberates the drinks through your skin. Expensive wine bars in NYC where you can still see cocaine residue on the toilet seats. Hell, one time my Marine squad split a sample pack of airplane liquor bottles in a burnt out cafe in Iraq on Christmas. 

Now, with all that experience, I can say that Cat’s Paw is the best bar on the north side of Division . . . east of 35th . . . and west of whatever bar is east of Cat’s Paw on Division. 

I first laid eyes on this place while having a lovely dinner and bottle of wine at the wine bar across the street. I gestured the server over and whispered in a conspiring tone “That . . . place, across the street. Is it reputable?” 

“Hell no!” she said. 

Well, I was in. I asked that server to slap the cork back on the Boone’s Farm, put my bologna and gherkin jar in a box, and bring my check. The server leaned in and said “Sir, you carried that all here yourself and have refused to leave with your French Bulldog for the last hour. Please go.”

Well, I was still in and had most of my jar of pickles too! So I made my way across Division, dodging Honda’s, Tesla’s, ebikes (thanks Barb!), and a woman perched precariously on the top of an eight foot tall unicycle made from straws removed from hapless aquatic creatures (she was passing out flyers). 

I finally made it through the rain and burst through the door with my dog in tow and it was a marvelous sight. The back door wafts in smoke from an enclosed patio where patrons drink beer and discuss being “elbow deep in raw tuna”. Inside, the patrons wish they were all making smoke from American Spirit cigarettes waft out the front door. This small, but cozy room is bathed in the red, neon Cat’s Paw sign that hangs on the window. The other light come from fixtures from the first patron in the door who, in turn, stole from the abandoned factory they slept in last night, making the ambience . . . not awful. 

The music is . . . there. In the span of a pint and a pull of whiskey made in the boot of the bartender while he was wearing it last night, you’ll hear Merle, Metallica, Aretha, bucket drums recorded on a Walkman in 1982, the guy in his apartment upstairs singing Megan Thee Stallion, and the sound of a guy playing a guitar with two strings, one of which is netting from a basketball hoop. 
Overlooking this all is a taxidermied bobcat. Perched precariously above the bar, paw outstretched, he serves as a reminder that patrons that do not close their bill will be shot in the ass by a drunken Hillsboro resident in a 2A shirt. The art adorning the wall is one part tattoo-shop-where-I-got-my-first-tattoo-for-25-dollars and one part how-do-you-even-build-a-unicycle-from-straws.

The patrons are what makes this place work. We do live in a capitalist society after all, so this goes without saying, but I needed a segue. Young men in black, skinny jeans and skinny leather jackets. The college sophomore who spent the year after high school in Asia but still complains about the rain. Her boyfriend, man bun Manfred who is part of the All Man Brother band who keeps playing that two string guitar for social justice. (He tells me I need an “Are” in his poetic band name. I tell him to get his own Nextdoor account). The two guys who bought their Harley Davidsons two days ago for cheap along with all their gear staring out at the drizzle wondering how they could have been fooled. The woman in her Lulu Lemon gear wondering why she came in here, but chatting it up with another woman wearing a poodle skirt and corset with a tattoo that starts at her big toe and stops at her delicate chin. (Lulu knows she’ll be back). The woman in a cardigan with a nervous chihuahua frantically chomping gum trying to get a glass of wine. (They serve wine from a box, as a proper bar should). 

And then there’s me, holding down a table with a jar of pickles with my dog, Madam FatsNBurps. So come on in. Don’t try to be cool, cause nobody here is, until you’re here, and then it’s all cool.

Yes, we have our share of Tesla Superchargers, but with new EVs coming from nearly every other manufacturer in 2021/2022, we have only a couple non-Tesla DC fast chargers available. For example, it would be almost impossible to make a trip from Indy to Evansville and back, as there are no fast chargers on that I69 route. There are a few older & slower chargers available, but those can take *hours* to charge up any substantial range.

I'd like to send a message to the appropriate government office / official to push them for more non-Tesla DC Fast Charging coverage along our major Interstate corridors. Of course charging stations are not a government service, but certainly they would have more influence (incentives) to get outside companies to consider adding additional stations in Indiana.

I've wanted a Tesla for a while and finally considering getting one as my current vehicle lease is coming to an end. 

&#x200B;

I am looking at the Model 3 Long Range AWD. I am currently looking at getting a 2021 Model 3, because those have a heat pump which from my research, is a lot more efficient as far as Range in the colder months. Now I could save quite a bit of money (\~10K) if I purchase a 2018 to 2020 model that does not come equipped with a heat pump.

I will be parking in a Non-Heated garage with 110v or 120v outlets (i need to check).

&#x200B;

I am looking for general advice about owning one of these through the colder months in winter as well as some specific questions about

1. Do you own a Tesla without the Heat Pump and have you had any extreme issues with losing range during the winter?
2. Do you wish you would have gotten the 2021 model with a Heat Pump?

&#x200B;

Any other advice is greatly appreciated as I am trying to do my due diligence and research before buying one.

https://www.vox.com/videos/22280067/highways-traffic-worse-congestion-expansion

> We investigate the effect of lane kilometers of roads on vehicle-kilometers traveled (VKT) in US cities. VKT increases proportionately to roadway lane kilometers for interstate highways and probably slightly less rapidly for other types of roads. The sources for this extra VKT are increases in driving by current residents, increases in commercial traffic, and migration. Increasing lane kilometers for one type of road diverts little traffic from other types of road. We find no evidence that the provision of public transportation affects VKT. We conclude that increased provision of roads or public transit is unlikely to relieve congestion. (JEL R41, R48)

s1bu3n,Tesla Strikes Battery-Metal Deal in Push to Ensure Supply... Is There Additional Opportunity?,"&#x200B;

Note that there is a massive laterite nickel in the Northwoods. The state needs to capitalize on this resource to level up in its 21st Century economy.

  [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-strikes-battery-metal-deal-223721833.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-strikes-battery-metal-deal-223721833.html)

I have researched and believe that Woodbury has a true case to win a bid for a Tesla Gigafactory. Maybe this would just be a battery manufacturing facility. This is fine. This would align with the 2040 Plan to develop the Northeast corridor into a powerhouse of next generation manufacturing. This may seem unrealistic, however there are three points that Minnesota could use to make Woodbury the destination for this site. 

The first key point is that the factory would be in close proximity to the Tesla Brooklyn Park Facility. This facility creates turnkey subsystems for manufacturing locations inside of the Tesla network. This work will create a significant tailwind for production ramp up and ongoing operations. The start up of systems will be much easier for the Brooklyn Park team to support than global locations or even operations inside of the United States. This is a true asset for the Twin Cities metro to leverage. 

The second piece of the opportunity are the human resources. The Twin Cities have the requisite resources for next era Automotive industry. I know Elon Musk would acknowledge this fact when you reference Medtronic. Tesla briefly collaborated with Medtronic for ventilator manufacturing during the April Covid 19 shortage. The workforce that we demonstrate with Andersen Windows shows that we have strong talent in the arena of operations. I have worked around the world and no manufacturing population rivals the Upper Midwest with true value added manufacturing. As to be synergistic with current operations, 3M web handling technology, Aveka Powder handling knowledge are huge assets to local battery manufacturing in the new era of battery cells. 

The third factor will exploit the resources in Minnesota’s Northwoods. There is a large deposit of Battery grade Nickel. Talon Metals have discovered a massive deposit of the material. If you could collaborate with State, Local Officials and Talon personnel as well as Tesla, we could remove ambiguity in nickel supply, timing, cost and environmental impact as well as having an economic multiplier by manufacturing in state. I would also push for a local recycling center in Duluth, when the mining resource is exhausted. This area would really appreciate a sustained long term investment, due to recent paper industry related struggles.

The barriers and road blocks that will be encountered with relate to proximity of the factory to the east coast. This is alleviated by access to Interstate 94 but will likely be the biggest barrier to the business case laid out above. I have never asked anything of government in the past. I just see this as an opportunity to lift up the Minnesota/West Wisconsin area economically and prepare for the green economy in the decade to come. I am confidant that Xcel will push along the path to green energy. I would also note that we may need to offer an expedited closure of the Allen S King power plant and invest in energy storage to facilitate the greenest production possible. This is unfortunate. I feel for the workers and their families. However, this plan would offer them true opportunity for the future. 

I understand that this plan is a bit eccentric, however how do we look forward in society? I would like to set the future to make Woodbury and the greater metro a powerhouse of economic growth. Lets understand that 3M has provided a large portion of the economic bounty that Woodbury has enjoyed. If we can facilitate this action, you would be responsible for a new generation of opportunity. This will augment the future and allow for extreme prosperity. Imagine the pride in manufacturing the next generation of battery energy storage in Woodbury, using Minnesota resources and creating lifechanging opportunity for young people. I really hope that Woodbury is open to manufacturing. I love this area of the world and want true prosperity in the future. I have no way of contacting Tesla personnel but I thought that this may be my best chance at a public voice.",minnesota,https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/s1bu3n/tesla_strikes_batterymetal_deal_in_push_to_ensure/,1/11/2022 12:30,0,16,minnesota

thxkpm,Seeking advice and insight into Solar panels. What can you tell me?,"Hello fellow Oregonians. We are looking at taking advantage of the Fed credits and Oregon credits to get some solar panels installed. We have only had Blue Raven Solar come out and give us a quote for an approximately 7kW system (no battery cell, it would be something we would like to add when the tech is a bit better). All up the loan for system for 30K, after applying all possible deductions it comes out to about $110 a month. For first 5yrs they will send us $50/mo as a kind-of rebate. I think the deal is good given the panels are top quality, good warranty, all up costs covered in monthly payments. But there are many companies out there..

I am trying to get some understanding of what other companies are offering and would appreciate all recommendations or testimonials. What was your experience like, was it worth it now that you have it etc..

ty2llv,What can you tell me about electric vehicles in Minnesota?,"Mostly interested in info  from actual owners / mechanics. Mostly Interested in winter problems.

I know very little about cars. Mostly biked and took metro transit as an adult. Sorry for dumb questions. I’ve been doing a little DIY solar install so I know a little about batteries.

I think that EV batteries were lithium ion but they are now moving to LiFePo4 batteries? Are there different batteries used in EVs for cold weather? Are there near future alternatives?

My biggest confusion is how are batteries heated? Are there internal heating pads on the batteries?  I assume a Tesla owner has a garage attached to a house, I assume this type of garage is slightly warmer than street parking. Can EVs handle winter street parking? How many days can you park on the street in the winter before the batteries are dead?

What other problems do the batteries have in the winter I should consider?


Are conversions street legal in Minnesota? Are there companies doing this yet? I don’t have the skills to DIY and paying for the conversion labor might be too expensive.  

I have an old Ford Fiesta with an engine problem. Everything else is great on the car. Replacing the engine is probably 80% or more the value of my car. I would only need this for short city trips I can give up the previous range. Even if possible at this time it would be cheaper and easier to do that tax credit donation than convert the car.  How long until converting cars with engine problems to EVs will be a possibility?

vloe6v,We should plan a general strike. Why should we continue to run the machine?,"I don’t care if you like everything that I put on the following list, but I’m damn sure you care for at least one of them.

*Abortion rights- 50% of this nation’s population just lost rights to healthcare. You all know, or are someone who will be affected by this, or currently being affected by it out of state.

* Worker’s rights- most of you are massively underpaid, treated with blatant disrespect, overworked, burnt out and can’t afford rising prices. You are the BLOOD of this country. It doesn’t run without you.

* Rising prices- Landlords raising prices every other renewal by insane amounts, gas prices nearly $5 a gallon, which is the highest I’ve seen in my 30 years. I’m coming home from the store spending more money on less food. We are being bled dry with stagnant wages to make sure that billionaires get shit they broke our backs for.

*Covid- Yeah, yeah I know. Everyone is sick of it, literally. We still have to deal with it though, it’s not over. We still have to take time off for positive exposure, on our own dime. Still have to take on extra work for sick coworkers, or just forced work while we’re sick. People with autoimmune disorders are still forced to go to work or starve, old folks are still at risk. 1million+ people have died because we had to just keep working.

*Civil rights- Some people might not appreciate methods used by protesters to get the attention of the country, but it got your attention. Unless you’re a straight white Christian male, your rights are under attack. Point blank. If you are a straight white Christian male, understand empathy and understand that people can live differently. Respect thy neighbors, cast the first stone if you’re without sin, judge not lest ye be judged. Fight for people’s right to exist and enjoy the one life they’ve been given. Just listen, really listen to folks and don’t say dumb shit.

There are so many things that could be on this list, if you have any you would like to discuss, throw it in the comments. Making money and keeping it moving is dependent on workers, this state and country run off your labor. Why are we keeping them running if they can’t treat most of the workforce like humans? CEOs don’t deserve a second Tesla or vacation home when I know people working 12+ hours a day who are barely scraping by because wages are 10+ years stagnant. We can shut it down with communication and solidarity, we have a voice and can  demand change. Raindrops can make a river.
 
TLDR; We don’t have to work if they can’t treat us like living breathing humans. That is our power.

w9qrvr,How to navigate setting up EV Charger Time of Use Charging Rate at Home - Hawaiian Electric,"Hi Reddit Community,

I have been trying to time of use charging on my Tesla wall connector I recently installed in my garage. Revolusun installed the charger but apparently has no experience setting up a time of use meter with Hawaiian Electric and is asking $1k + for a deposit to navigate the permit and installation of the second meter with HECO. Frankly this makes no sense from a cost / benefit since it would take well over 5 years to pay back the install costs. 

&#x200B;

Does anyone currently have time of use charging setup on their EV charger at home which has reduced electrical rates when charging from 9am-5pm? I am looking for a licensed electrican that has experience navigating the process and am looking for any recommendations you might have from personal experience.

wyyynl,Massive Freeway Clozure Yesterday --- Eye-Seventeen Southbound --- VALUABLE LESSONS!,"As much as I travel I-17 sooner or later it had to happen.

I-17 closed due to a wreck and I was stuck motionless for hours with little idea what was going on.

Rounding a corner past the (3-lane) Camp Verde climb-out, on the shallow descent into Cordes Junction a couple of CDOT trucks with their lights flashing were parked at odd angles on the shoulder.  Thinking ""lane closure"" I slowed a bit so I wasn't directly beside another driver, and around the next corner the whole thing came to a rapid stop.

I later saw two of the vehicles \[I believe were\] involved in the collision on a flatbed. One was an utterly destroyed pickup truck. TBH it looked more like what I usually see coming OUT of a crusher at a junkyard than what goes in.  It had either rolled a dozen times or gone underneath an 18 wheeler.  Total destruction.  *A commenter below suggested perhaps the flatbed, CARRYING that truck had rolled.*

Where traffic initially stopped there was no way to see very far ahead, and within a few minutes folks were getting out of their cars, etc.  No cellphone coverage 4 me.  I talked to a couple of truckers only to discover most don't have CB radios anymore. They had no idea what was going on either. One was trying to download an APP that would let them hear CB chatter.  Folks were sharing what they'd learned from calling others at home, etc. but none of the information was actionable.

ADOT was of no use whatsoever,  Tweeting ""Highway is closed at MM268, no ETA on re-opening""  2 1/2 hours later,  about the time traffic finally started moving again for good. There were rumors they had Tweeted one lane was open, and indeed for about 20 minutes traffic crawled forward at 3 mph, and then came to a complete stop again for 30+.  I never saw that Tweet.

I passed and was passed by a white Tesla repeatedly, wondering what HIS or HER level of charge was looking like. It must have been of concern because at some point they turned off the (electricity driven) AC and rolled down the windows when traffic was dead stopped. **The saving grace of yesterday's shutdown was that it was only about 90 degrees out.**  At 100+ it would have been misery.

Before traffic started ""crawling,"" after an initial 45 minute wait or so, **an entire line of drivers had managed to U-turn, and were selfishly attempting to drive THE WRONG WAY up the southbound shoulder** to the previous exit, more than 10 miles back. They ended up royally screwing themselves as well as everyone else. Emergency vehicles coming from the North could not use the shoulder blocked by these assholes to reach the scene. And then when traffic started flowing finally --- how were they gonna manage a second U-turn across a freeway with traffic barreling @ 70mph?

I'm still chuckling at the two old farts towing a golf cart that somehow managed to ""flip a bitch"" and join that line of wrong-way drivers.  They might still be out there...  FORE!

When traffic began crawling, I saw a sweaty young woman, in running tights, talking on her cellphone, walking briskly up the median. What the hell, I thought?  Where's she going? Getting in a power walk?

She had abandoned her car in the fast lane when it ran out of fuel or whatever about a mile down the road.  Not knowing it was hers I threw on my emergency flashers and got out to help some ""Person"" roll their stalled car backwards to the shoulder, only to discover an empty vehicle.  It would have taken a lot of cooperation from other drivers even to do that, but without a driver or keys.... I got back in my vehicle and went around. Dumb, dumb, dumb!  Signal your need for help by putting your hood up.  Get out, stand behind the guardrail, but don't abandon your car.  No cell coverage?  Ask someone to call FOR you when they get coverage.  Need fuel?  Leave your hood up & gas  door hanging open!  Folks WILL help you! 

When traffic DID begin actually moving again, a couple of large vehicles -- one a heavy service truck, another an 18 wheeler, didn't move. Had the drivers dozed off? But everyone was driving too aggressively, whipping around on the shoulder  to knock on the cab, see if they were ok or needed a tow or gas or whatever. What had 10 minutes before been a polite crowd, standing around chatting and sharing bottled water was now ""Every man for him/her self!""

It was like the start of the Indy 500 once it opened up.  A red Tesla did some very aggressive and dangerous passing on the right of entire lines of cars patiently waiting to go around slow 18 wheelers down near Black Canyon.  Wish I could have gotten his plate. 

Lessons learned:  Don't let your fuel state get below 1/2 because you never know when you're gonna get to sit for hours. Keep water and snacks in your car --- especially if you are traveling with kids or a pet.  An empty milk jug or DEF fluid bottle makes a great **emergency** gas can.  Don't expect much from ADOT in terms of information. And especially, don't do selfish shit that makes it take even longer to get the accident cleared!   

**Lastly.**

I know it's fun to drive a little aggressively down the I-17.  Especially through the twisties near Bumblebee. But the older I get, the more I see the consequences of even a moment's inattention, a single driving mistake, a  failure to leave safe following distances.   Someone died yesterday, and thousands of others were snarled for hours. **Don't be a dick.

But with the rate hikes coming and my last few crazy heat wave/AC induced electric bills I think I'm ready to at least crunch some numbers and figure out if its worth it.

\- last 6 mo electricity usage - 580, 599, 699, 1386, 1637, 2019 kWh. (Low in winter and heavy in summer (AC, pool pump)

xrbrqj,Experiences with Tesla Solar Panels?,"Hi all!

We've been researching solar for the past two months because of all of the issues with RI Energy. It looks like we need a fairly hefty system, at least 10kW and probably more like 14 or 15kW. We've looked at SunRun, Trinity Solar, Sol Power, SunWatt and Tesla.  These seem like the vendors people have recommended most.  

It looks like the price (before any credits or incentives) of our system will end up being in the mid- to high- $40K.  However, for that price Tesla's system includes a battery while the other vendors would need something like $10-$20K more to add one. Tesla's panels, by themselves, are about $10K cheaper than anyone else and their battery is about $10K cheaper. They are putting  14.8kW on the roof but the amount of power generated a year seems to be the same as the company putting 16kW on the roof.

With our particular shading situation, it doesn't look like our property qualifies for anything except for the federal tax credit and the eventual ConnectedSolutions benefit of $5000 for using our battery. Everyone we've talked to has agreed on that. It also looks like Tesla's financing is currently cheaper than any other option at the moment, except that we could probably get 0% financing on the battery from another company; that doesn't seem to make up for the almost $10,000 price difference. The financing available from other companies also seems to make the total cost of the loan more expensive than Tesla, sometimes by a substantial amount.

I know at least one user on this subreddit is very happy with Tesla and has given us a lot of information to work with. I also understand that they can be a real pain to deal with from a paperwork and support (even the user who really liked Tesla agreed on that). However, I can't imagine what kind of customer support would be worth $20K. 

I'd really like to use a local company and the Sol Power and SunWatt people were nice and seemed trustworthy.  Sol Power has been the only one to physically get on our roof and measure anything.  I know some people here have used them. My question is: did you look at Tesla? If you did and went with someone else, what ultimately sold you on going with the higher priced option? Or did it end up really being higher priced? I think I'm finding out that price is the deciding factor for me, but I'm still concerned I'm missing something.

Thanks everyone in advance for your thoughts. I'm really open to options; we almost pulled the trigger with Tesla and then conversations here and with the state energy office made us reconsider and get some local quotes to see if there were other incentives we could get or a better price.",RhodeIsland,https://www.reddit.com/r/RhodeIsland/comments/xrbrqj/experiences_with_tesla_solar_panels/,9/29/2022 16:09,5,29,rhodeisland

yp6d7a,Beto O'Rourke isn't going to take your goddamn guns,"I am just appalled at the early voting turnout for this election. This could potentially be a critical junction point for our state and our country, and more Texans are staying home than in the last election.

Look, the Democrats aren't perfect, but the reality is that you [really only have two choices](https://youtu.be/s7tWHJfhiyo). And the strongest objection I've seen to Beto on here is his stance on guns.

Well, get the fuck over it.

He isn't going to confescate your guns. He won't be able to. Even if he wanted to, which he doesn't. 

So maybe, *maybe*, he might make it a little harder for you to get *more* guns. Is that really a problem, given Uvalde and everything else that's happened in Texas over the past decade?

The Republican party seems dead-set on fascism and Texas could be a critical state, since the Supreme Court could potentially rule that [state legislatures can completely overrule the electoral college](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/10/us/politics/supreme-court-state-legislature-elections.html).

But even if you don't buy the fascism argument, how about just plain old corruption? User /u/inconvenientnews summed up the [Texas Republican party's corruption](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/ndspsd/texas_wants_to_charge_tesla_other_ev_owners_400/gyd9apn/) better than I ever could over a year ago.

Don't like Beto? Okay, don't vote for him. Arguably, the other offices are much more important than governor. Wouldn't it be nice to have a [Lt. Governor](https://www.collierfortexas.com/issues/) who is dead set on fixing our rickety power grid instead of caving to whatever campaign donor throws a few dollars his way? Or an [actually qualified CPA comptroller](https://www.janetdudding4texas.com/issues/) who is *hardcore* all about weed legalization? Or maybe a [competent attorney general](https://www.rochellegarzafortexas.com/issues) who isn't literally under federal indictment for corruption?

Your state and federal representatives and your state senator are arguably even *more* important in this election than ever, given the state of civil and voting rights in this country. Republicans have taken pretty much every opportunity they can to [vote against the interests of most people](https://www.reddit.com/r/phoenix/comments/xr9u56/juan_ciscomani_literally_walks_away_from_arizona/iqgu2lo/).

I used to consider myself a moderate (even voted for Kay Bailey Huchinson back in the day), but I decided around a decade or so ago that I absolutely could not support the Republican party, since at a national level they seem hellbent on eroding our civil rights, and at the state level, they seem absolutely determined to turn our amazing state into an international laughing stock.

If you're registered to vote (and didn't vote early), then this is your chance to prove that we can do better. Anyone with an R by their name deserves to go.

Take the time. You can take up to 2 hours off work if you need it. Most counties let you vote at any polling place within your county.

zhj8hs,"Why Are Car Brands Like Volvo, VW, and Mazda So Popular In Some Boston Suburbs Like Cambridge/Somerville/Brookline?","In Cambridge and Brookline, two of the most prevalent car brands are Toyota and Honda, just like the state as a whole and they are some of the most popular brands in the US.

However, in my neighbourhood (close to Harvard), 'lesser' brands such as Mazda, Volkswagen (very common in Europe/China, not so much in the states), and Volvo seem to be very popular, with me seeing at least 10-30 from each brand per day in Cambridge during my commute using a bike. Even though Saab stopped making cars and isn't so common in the US, I still see at least 2-5 Saabs per day in Cambridge.

Yet, despite Nissan is one of the top selling brands in the US, I haven't been seeing many Nissans in my neighbourhood in recent months (in fact, I see more Volvos, Mazdas, VWs at parallel parking spaces near my apartment and would typically only see 2-5 Nissans parked at parking spaces within a 5-minute walk from my apartment).

It is not only Nissan that doesn't seem to be so popular in Cambridge and Brookline given the fact it is the 5th most common in Massachusetts. Even though Ford and Chevrolet are some of the US's best sellers, I have not been seeing many Ford and Chevrolet around my neighbourhood (even though they also make passenger cars like the Escape, Fusion, Focus, Malibu, etc) and instead, I see more Subarus and VWs (I would admit, Subaru is quite popular in the Northeastern states).

I have also seen a lot of luxury brands such as BMW, Mercedes Benz, Audi in both Cambridge and Brookline, and seen more cars from each of those brands than Nissan in both these cities, even though Nissan is one of the largest in the US (Nissan is the 3rd largest Japanese automaker in the US, larger than both Subaru and Mazda)

I am curious why some 'lesser' car brands end up being so popular in Cambridge/Somerville/Brookline whilst some more bigger automotive brands are not so popular in those cities, like Ford, Chevy, Dodge, Chrysler, and GMC? In fact, I see more Jeeps in my neighbourhood than Nissans.

I was driving from west to east coast during the holiday times and got pulled over by a cop 10pm on Christmas Eve. 

He said I was driving 93 when passing him in a 75 zone. I am almost certain I wasn’t. I remembered seeing his car from afar and was wondering why that car was parked on the side of the highway and had no light on, I even wondered if that car needed help. I then checked my speed, it was 75mph, and then I passed that car with no acceleration. Soon after I passed, he put on the police light and I got pulled over. 

I’ve never gotten a ticket before, what should I do in this case? Do I have to go to court in Kansas to say that I’ve been wrongfully ticketed? I’m hoping that I don’t have to return to Kansas for this ticket because I live in a state that’s quite far.

11h25ga,Is this housing bubble in CT just price gouging? My theory and some gaps in my existing knowledge.,"One of the theories I've started to believe is that most of the inflation caused by the pandemic was actually just businesses and individuals using the excuse of inflation to jack prices on essential goods as much as physically possible. The mechanics of capitalism start to break down when discussing things required for survival (shelter, energy, food, transportation, etc.). Go figure these are the areas that have seen the worst inflation over the last couple years. 

Put another way, if all the home owners, grocery stores, Eversource, etc. all decided collectively to 20x their prices tomorrow, you would still have to pay it because the alternative is to move or die. Closer to a master-slave dynamic than a consumer-producer one. You didn't really see the same level of inflation in luxury goods (see the recent price cut in tesla's for example) because people have the choice to buy something cheaper purely to meet their utilitarian needs instead. But now those utilitarian options are the ones that have been price gouged. 

Which leads me to CT real estate...

The main arguments for why our home prices have risen so much in the last 2 years is because net immigration surged as people left major cities, and because of low interest rates. My theory is that both of these arguments are illegitimate and that this is just another case of price gouging. 

For one thing, interest rates have shot back up now, and prices haven't really dropped at all. 

Second, the net immigration to our state during the pandemic has already been completely reversed

[https://www.ctinsider.com/connecticut/article/ct-migration-population-census-17740546.php#:\~:text=In%20the%20July%202021%2Dto,net%20moves%20to%20other%20states](https://www.ctinsider.com/connecticut/article/ct-migration-population-census-17740546.php#:~:text=In%20the%20July%202021%2Dto,net%20moves%20to%20other%20states)

CT has, in its recent history, seen a slow and steady population decline as younger people move to big cities, businesses leave or threaten to leave to follow that labor force, and older people move south to retire. This had led to an underperforming real estate market. Nobody wants to buy real estate in a declining state. 

That all changed after the pandemic, we saw housing prices across the board basically **double**. And those prices have held, even after the interest rates went back up. 

To be clear, I could somewhat understand real estate rising in Fairfield county, as that was a desirable area for New Yorkers specifically even before the pandemic, and would be a natural place for them to move to during the pandemic. But Tolland County? Windham? I just don't see it man. Houses in Coventry that were valued at **150k** 2 years ago are now listing at **300k**, predicated entirely on low interest rates that **no longer exist**, net immigration that **no longer exists**, and a supposed influx of wealthy New Yorkers that I don't believe **ever existed**. This is a gap in my knowledge though. 

Does anyone have data regarding net immigration from New York to CT Counties outside of Fairfield during the pandemic? I can't find much info online about it, and it just seems preposterous to me that they'd wanna drive for hours each way to work. 

TL;DR- CT real estate has doubled state-wide based purely on psychological desperation and price gouging, with no legitimate causes or reasons for it to remain so high.",Connecticut,https://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/11h25ga/is_this_housing_bubble_in_ct_just_price_gouging/,3/3/2023 14:29,5,169,connecticut

From what I understand, this gives extensive access to not only see my odometer, but also locations, speed, among many other attributes. Most concerning is the API also allows unlocking of the vehicle. When I called UDOT to see if there was any other method for enrolling without giving up privacy, they said there was no other method.

I called the DMV, three times... first person said yes you have to go through to get VIN verified, second person said no if MV-212 Application for Title is signed by Tesla ""DMV specialist"" (yes it is). Called again to get a tie-breaker, and what do you know, TWO more answers for yes and no.

123nkej,"Inside the crazy, mixed-up world of electric-vehicle charger pricing","From [Globe.com](https://Globe.com):

Electric vehicle adoption is booming, even as Massachusetts is far behind in its plans to reduce carbon emissions from cars and trucks. But charging outside of the home is the Achilles heel of the EV industry, with inconsistent and sometimes high pricing policies, frequently broken equipment, and a lack of chargers in key locations for everyone but Tesla drivers.

It’s enough to give EV drivers a constant headache — and to make people thinking about going electric wait a little longer. Compounding the frustration is that the price of electricity in Massachusetts has skyrocketed, and that increase is already hitting drivers looking to recharge.

To capture the current state of EV charging, the Globe did an informal survey of the pricing and performance of DC (Level 3) fast chargers around Greater Boston over the past three months. While most current EV owners charge at home overnight using slower Level 1 and 2 chargers, DC fast chargers are critical for longer trips and for people who can’t charge at home. Based on the experiences of a reporter charging four different vehicles across five charging networks, a few themes emerged.

Reliability is a major issue, with chargers going offline for weeks or months at a time. Some stations charge by the minute rather than by the amount of electricity consumed, leading to unpredictable pricing. Others have multiple subscription plans or charge different rates at different times of day. Overall, there have been some significant price increases over the past few months.

“It seems like there are so many factors at play,” said Ed Harrison, a Nissan Leaf owner in West Newton who prefers to charge at home as often as possible. “If I’m doing it elsewhere, it’s because I have to, so I’ll pretty much pay whatever they charge me.”

And whatever they charge is going up.

Electrify America, one of the largest operators of DC fast-charging stations in the state, just raised prices by 16 to 19 percent. Smaller rival EVgo made its rate plans more complicated and added a new fee. And Tesla, which raised prices at many of its chargers last year, is slowly opening its national network to other car brands but with higher prices for non-Tesla vehicles.

Charging companies said they needed to raise prices after utilities increased their rates. Electricity prices jumped to 39 cents per kilowatt-hour in February from 27 cents a year earlier, a 44 percent rise in the Boston metro area, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

In EVGo charging sessions by a Globe reporter, prices averaged 61 cents per kilowatt-hour in March after the new rate plan took effect, compared to 42 cents in January. At Electrify America, effective rates per kilowatt-hour calculated by the Globe rose from 20 cents to 26 cents (though the company charges by the minute, adding an element of uncertainty).

At ChargePoint terminals owned by MassDOT, such as along I-95 and Route 24, prices have remained steady at 35 cents per kilowatt-hour. And prices have been steady at 70 cents — the highest in the survey — at the Nouria network. That new entrant is owned by convenience store chain Nouria Energy and has installed a few DC fast chargers so far in the southeastern region of the state. The calculations include fees and taxes tacked on by the operators.",massachusetts,https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/123nkej/inside_the_crazy_mixedup_world_of_electricvehicle/,3/27/2023 13:53,15,20,massachusetts

12dx9r4,Updates on Solar Net Metering Changes in North Carolina,"Hey, y'all! I work for a local solar company and Certified B Corporation based in Raleigh. I’d like to share some big news that has hit the North Carolina solar industry... net metering is changing! On March 23rd, the North Carolina Utilities Commission approved Duke Energy’s proposed changes to its net metering structure.

Whether you already have solar or you're interested in going solar, I just want to make sure everyone has access to the right information about the changes. Here's what we know so far:

Duke Energy is piloting a change to the net metering program that will add different fees for new customers who go solar after July 1, 2023. The new net metering program will also introduce a modified net metering structure and a secondary time-of-use rate plan with a new billing system.

**If you already have solar – Nothing is changing for you until 2027!** On January 1, 2027, you’ll be moved to a modified net metering rate called a bridge rate with a different set of fees applied to solar customers.

**If you are considering solar – My advice is to go solar before July 1, 2023.** Going solar before July 1 will grandfather you into the existing net metering system and give you more options for how you are compensated for solar in the future.

Once the full set of changes goes into effect after July 1st, there will be more complexity in the solar modeling process because of the added TOU rate variables. This makes it even more important to consult with a local, well-established solar company (bonus points if they’re a B Corp!) who understands the ins and outs of the new rate structure. Bottom line – making that decision now, before things get more complicated after July 1st, will give you more certainty. Here is a resource with more information: [https://southern-energy.com/north-carolina-net-metering-update/](https://southern-energy.com/north-carolina-net-metering-update/)

Westbound I-44 is shut down about mile marker 157, between St. Robert and Waynesville, due to a small child, about 5 years old, who fell out of an open window of a silver minivan that continued down the interstate. An emergency medevac helicopter has been dispatched. #PulaskiCountyMo #PulaskiCountyMoMVA #WaynesvilleMo #SaintRobertMo

The helicopter is landing on I-44 about 6:05 p.m. The major crash team has been notified.

As of 6:12 p.m., it does not appear the vehicle has been located. **THIS IS NOT CONFIRMED.** Emergency personnel say that rather than being a minivan, ""This may have been a smaller SUV.""

Emergency personnel have witnesses, mostly in their 20s and 30s, at least some of whom are from the Pulaski County area.

Lifeline helicopter is headed for University Hospital in Columbia, as of 6:24 p.m.

Waynesville Police Department officers have been called to go to a location believed to be the residence of the parents of the child involved in this incident.

As of 6:44 p.m., Waynesville Police are being asked to attempt to locate video ""of the child running away."" Not clear what this means.

As of 6:56 p.m., emergency personnel have obtained video that they believe confirms that a semi tractor-trailer did strike the child on I-44.

12y1n7a,Solar explained from A to Z,"Solar is very simple. They make $10,000 for labor to install. It's a simple kit! Mounts, panels, inverters, metal tube, disconnect, and meter. That is all!!! A 'roofer' drills the mounts into the thick ribs of the roof. A handyman type solar guy assembles the support racking under the panels. An electrician connects the panels with a wire in a metal tube for protection, and screws a disconnect and a meter into the side of your house. A remote structural engineer okay's the whole set up that it won't fall apart. Boom! All done! If one of the 70 mounts leak, they take them out and reapply with new glue (geocell 1000). Some brackets go on top, others under a shingle (much better). Some of the time the inverters die, so they come and replace the inverter. SolarEdge inverters die a lot more than Enphase inverters, but the latter a lot more expensive and few companies install them due to the extra cost.

Tesla installs solar the cheapest, but their roof mounts leak. So, I'm wondering if you can just replace the roof beforehand and put Ice and Water Shield membrane on the side of the roof where the panels will go. This way, their roof penetrations are less likely to leak in my opinion, and the vapor barrier may not be such a big issue since the other side of the roof doesn't have the ice and water shield membrane. Solar makes sense if you are getting a new roof at the same time. Take off and reinstall is a fee for when asphalt shingles die in 15 years despite what their useless liar warranty says. If you don't want to risk roof leaks, then get an installer that uses mounts that slide under the shingle with 'flashing'. It will be a local installer that charges $10,000 more than Tesla though. You can also pay even more money to get better equipment that is less likely to break such as Enphase microinverters. Go to Umass5 credit union, and get a loan for the panels and the roof. You can't claim the roof under IRS like the companies say though - read the irs.gov statement on it. The panels usually don't break, but the inverters do, and the installer may replace them for free or you may have to pay extra to do it if the warranty has lapsed or when the company goes out of business, and most of them do. Tesla has bad customer service, so you may end up waiting a longer time to fix roof leaks or get system connected initially or turned back on if it breaks. The solar companies buy solar panels and inverters in bulk, and usually go for the one they can get the cheapest and then put it into the design for everyone they quote. Some pick better quality equipment to give people a better design. If they source and install an American made solar panel, then you can claim 40% tax federal tax credit instead of only the 30% (extra 10%). The panels supply your house and pump electricity back up to the grid, then at night you buy electricity from the grid just like you did paying a delivery fee and per kwh rate as before. New England gives you a form of 'carbon credits' called RECs which pay you per kwh you produce just because you are being green, which ends up being like a $100 check a month, and the electric company gives you credits for the extra electricity you produce that you can use later at the end of the year or maybe even give it to a friend. Solar makes the most sense when replacing the roof at the same time. Also, it doesn't make sense for older people who may not live to see it save them money in total or if you are selling the house. Also, if you want to re-roof, then taking off the panels is an extra fee which might be thousands of dollars. The other part is the electrician just installs a metal tube for the wires that go through an extra meter on the side of your house. You don't even have to upgrade your panel to 200 amps - the solar doesn't affect the panel you have! For those who know, solar is a simple kit and the electrician just does the same three steps over and over. They make about $10,000 on each install, but their overhead is having sales people give out endless free quotes and designs. Some solar sales guys are paid $10,000 per job they sell and can make $100,000/month. The cost breaks down to 30/30/30 equipment/labor/salesperson. Asphalt roof shingles only last 15-20 years unlike what the warranty says, so in that time, you will have to pay $5,000 to remove the panels for a re-roof and put them back or buy new ones.

But get this- the neighbor’s house ALSO has a meter that reads their usage and they are also been paying a monthly bill. So in essence, HECO has been collecting double!

UPDATE: First, thank you everyone for excellent advice and insight! Hubs talked to HECO and even the agent was confused by our bill as all it is showing is a steady upward trend, even though our lifestyle hasn’t changed in any way (if anything it should be going down bc landlord upgraded two major appliance).

14fqbwe,Urgent! Maine legislature voting Thursday to loosen mining protections in a MAJOR way,"**UPDATE: LD 1363 will likely be voted on Friday 23rd. Find your legislator legislators (link below) and tell them No! To LD 1363.**

The Maine legislature will be voting on LD 1363, ""An Act to Support Extraction of Common Minerals by Amending the Maine Metallic Mineral Mining Act"", effectively creating loopholes in  Maine's already insufficient mining laws that would reclassify lithium (and potentially other polymetallic minerals) to circumvent regulation under current restrictions. Drafted **without scientists in the room**, this bill has been fast tracked to kowtow to major extraction interests at the expense of our wild places, like Grafton Notch (open pit lithium mining) and Katahdin Woods and Waters (polymetallic sulfide mining).

Additionally, a mining company will potentially be able to evade any excise tax on metallic minerals that could be used to fund a portion of health and environmental impact mitigation. (Current Maine excise tax on metallic mining is the *lowest* in the country and has not been updated since the 1980s.)

I'm part of a grassroots collaboration of Maine residents who created [resistmainemining.org](https://resistmainemining.org) and I hope to hell we can get some upvotes on this post so folks know to reach out to their elected officials ASAP and say ""No to LD 1363!""

Doesn't anyone monitor the prices as they typically change twice a year. Even if a customer catches the outrageous price increase and tries to change it, it usually takes 1 to 2 billing cycles to actually change, meaning they are stuck with the high rates for a while.

159609u,Solar panel advice,"Husband and I are looking into switching to solar.


We're getting a lot of mixed information so I'm curious what Reddit has to say!


Rent vs Buy? (We are thinking buy)


Pros/ cons?


We met with the first company in our search yesterday and there doesn't *seem* to be a down side, but of course they just want to make a sale so we're skeptical. The person was saying that Eversource is incentived because once they reach 20% of their customers going solar, they get a tax break -- is that true?


On the other hand, a friend of ours told me not to buy any panels because the government gives them for free (??) But to me that sounds fishy. I can't find good info on that, other than anything you get for free isn't yours, you never own them.

So the new incentive says that if you purchase an EV and live in Maryland, you would be eligible for up to $3K for reimbursement for the excise (sales) tax. I'm looking to get a Tesla next month but there are a lot more vehicles available in VA than in MD. I'm currently located in MoCo.

I'm assuming it's okay to purchase the vehicle from out-of-state (and pay VA taxes) but was wondering if anybody had direct experience with the tax credit. I've never purchased a new vehicle before and this process is making me a bit anxious..haha

15gp5i7,Tesla Solar Panels & Powerwalls,"Aloha

For those who purchased and using Tesla Solar Panels & Powerwalls, are you happy with the products?

How did you go and started process?  Did you simply went to [Tesla.com](https://Tesla.com) and inserted your contact info and have them contacted you?  How soon do they reach back?  Just trying to understand how I can get started with them rather than local companies.

From the website, it says my home is best with 7.34 kW + 2 Powerwalls, how much am I expecting with this option?  Our home is just under 2,000 sqft and our monthly average bill is at $300.

SunRun, Kumu, RevuluSun all seem to have mixed reviews (more negative) and quoted me $50K before rebates/incentives/tax breaks.

UPDATE (8/3/2023 1030HST)  -- thanks for all the replies.  Another thing to mention is that we do not expect to live on Oahu for more than 4 years from today.  Things may change, but our plan is to move overseas or mainland.  I'm an engineer myself and did some calculations myself and from quotes, but ROI is looking like 7+ years even after incentives/tax/bonuses kick-in.  Some may say it will increase the value of your home but we think it won't matter too much.  I'm leaning towards simply living as we are without Solar and go through paperworks/constructions.

16py7v7,Biki Sucks,"When Biki first came out, I thought it was a great, innovative idea but nothing has changed since (not surprised). They were truly ahead of the curve in this aspect. However, time has passed and they're not electric, they're hard to come across, they're worn down, rusty, and just plain slow.

They're relatively expensive as well. New York City has the Citi Bike and although it costs more for an unlimiated day pass ($19 vs $15), it costs just $200 per year (unlimited) and has the same $4.50 single use cost. For that, you get well-maintained, abundant electric bicycles that are fast and can power up hills. Biki's $4.50 single use fee is horrible considering The Bus is just $3 and short Uber rides can be had for $7.

Hawaii has hills and bursts of wind that will bring you to a halt, requiring extra pedaling effort at times and in warm weather it means showing up to work in a sweat, which sucks.

An electric Biki would allow for expanded use, such as the Kahala and Hawaii Kai area, which has great bike paths. To be honest, an electric scooter system would be much easier and cost effective to manage vs a bike. Some cities had problems with them being dumped in random places, but some are getting better as they require riders to photograph the scooter after parking to avoid fees.

Driving sucks in Hawaii and there's no viable alternatives, so we need innovative solutions that are far better than what Biki has to offer. I hope the service will expand to electric or consider push scooters. Or I hope the city will allow for some competition from Lyft/Uber or anyone else.

16u6vac,"Electric cars need graphite and liberals want everyone to drive electric cars, just don't mine it in the USA.","# Tesla needs graphite. Western Alaska has plenty. But mining it raises fears in nearby villages. FROM ADN

## Graphite is a critical ingredient in the batteries needed to power America’s electric vehicle revolution. But every ounce of it is imported. A proposed mine on the Seward Peninsula would change that. But some of the people who live nearby fear it will endanger their way of life.

Ducks and swans flew overhead as Sylvester Ayek, 82, and his daughter Kimberly, 35, hauled rocks to anchor their small salmon net on the bank of a deep tidal channel 25 miles inland from the open Bering Sea coast.

Nearby on that July day, Mary Jane Litchard, Ayek’s partner, picked wild celery and set out a lunch of past subsistence harvests: a blue-shelled seabird egg, dried beluga whale meat and red salmon dipped in seal oil.

Then, as they waited for fish to fill the net, the family motored Ayek’s skiff up the channel, known as the Tuksuk, spotting birds and seals and passing family fish camps where drying salmon hung on racks. Soon, the steep channel walls gave way to a huge saltwater lake: the Imuruk Basin, flanked by the snow-dotted peaks of the Kigluaik Mountains.

Ayek describes the basin as a “traditional hunting and gathering place” for the local Iñupiat, who have long sustained themselves on the area’s bounty of fish, berries and wildlife.

But despite a long Indigenous history, and a brief settler boom during the Gold Rush more than a century ago, a couple of weather-beaten cabins were the only obvious signs of human impact as Ayek’s boat idled — save for a set of tiny, beige specks at the foot of the mountains.

Those specks were a camp run by a Canadian exploration company, Graphite One. And they marked the prospective site of a milewide open-pit mine that could reach deep below the tundra — into the [largest known deposit](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-graphite-deposits-united-states#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Geological%20Survey%20(USGS,New%20York%2C%20Pennsylvania%20and%20Texas.) of graphite in the U.S.

The mine could help power America’s electric vehicle revolution, and it’s drawing enthusiastic support from powerful government officials in both Alaska and Washington, D.C. That includes the Biden administration, which [recently announced](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3459556/dod-enters-agreement-to-expand-capabilities-for-domestic-graphite-mining-and-pr/) up to $37.5 million in subsidies for Graphite One through the U.S. Department of Defense.

So far, the announcements from the project’s politically connected boosters have received far more attention than the several hundred Alaskans whose lives would be affected directly by Graphite One’s mine.

While opinions in the nearby Alaska Native villages of Brevig Mission and Teller are mixed, there are significant pockets of opposition, particularly among the area’s tribal leaders. Many residents worry the project will harm the subsistence harvests that make life possible in a place where the nearest well-stocked grocery store is a two-hour drive away, in Nome.

“The further they go with the mine, our subsistence will just move further and further away from us,” Gilbert Tocktoo, president of Brevig Mission’s tribal government, said over a dinner of boiled salmon at his home. “And sooner or later, it’s going to become a question of: Do I want to live here anymore?”

Despite those concerns, Graphite One is gathering local support: Earlier this month, the board of the region’s Indigenous-owned, for-profit corporation unanimously endorsed the project.

The Nome-based corporation, Bering Straits Native Corp., also [agreed to invest $2 million](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/bsnc-invests-2-million-graphite-one) in Graphite One, in return for commitments related to jobs and scholarships for shareholders.

The tensions surrounding Graphite One’s project underscore how the [rush to bolster domestic manufacturing](https://rmi.org/how-the-inflation-reduction-act-will-spur-a-revolution-in-ev-battery-supply-chains/) of electric vehicles threatens a new round of disruption to tribal communities and landscapes [that have already borne huge costs](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/27/us/mining-clean-energy-antimony-tribes.html) from past mining booms.

Across the American West, companies are vying to extract the minerals needed to power electric vehicles and other green technologies. Proposed mines for [lithium](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/17/1188204958/tribes-object-federal-ruling-approves-lithium-mine), [antimony](https://www.inlander.com/news/a-company-plans-to-reopen-a-historic-mine-but-conservationists-warn-it-will-harm-wildlife-and-the-nez-perce-tribe-says-it-violates-treaty-ri-25305170) and [copper](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/interactive/ev-mineral-bonanza-on-alaska-tribal-land-turns-on-disputed-road) are chasing some of the same generous federal tax credits as Graphite One — and some are advancing in spite of objections from Indigenous people who have already seen their lands taken and resources diminished over more than a century of mining.

The Seward Peninsula’s history is a case in point: Thousands of non-Native prospectors came here during the Gold Rush, which began in 1898. The era brought devastating bouts of pandemic disease and displacement for the Iñupiat, and today, that history weighs on some as they consider how Graphite One could affect their lives.

“A lot of people like to say that our culture is lost. But we didn’t just go out there and lose it: It was taken from us,” said Taluvaaq Qiñuġana, a 24-year-old Iñupiaq resident of Brevig Mission. A new mining project in her people’s traditional harvesting grounds, she said, “feels like continuous colonization.”

But other Indigenous residents of Brevig Mission and Teller say the villages would benefit from well-paying jobs that could come with the mine. Cash income could help people sustain their households in the two communities, where full-time work is otherwise scarce.

Graphite One executives say one of their highest priorities, as they advance their project toward permitting and construction, is protecting village residents’ harvests of fish, wildlife and berries. They say they fully appreciate the essential nature of that food supply.

“This is very real to them,” said Mike Schaffner, Graphite One’s senior vice president of mining. “We completely understand that we can’t come in there and hurt the subsistence, and we can’t hurt how their lifestyle is.”

### U.S. produces no domestic graphite

Graphite is simply carbon — like a diamond but far softer, because of its different crystal structure. Graphite is used as a lubricant, in industrial steelmaking, for brake linings in automobiles and as pencil lead.

It’s also a key component of the high-powered lithium batteries that propel electric cars.

Once mined and concentrated, graphite is processed into a powder that’s mixed with a binder, then rolled flat and curled into the hundreds of AA battery-sized cylinders that make up the battery pack.

America [hasn’t mined any](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/americas-ev-ambitions-need-a-graphite-plan-fast/2023/02/09/3289dad0-a874-11ed-b2a3-edb05ee0e313_story.html) graphite in decades, having been undercut by countries where it’s extracted at a lower cost.

China currently produces [more than half](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf) of the world’s mined graphite and [nearly all of the highly processed type](https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/international-issues/graphite-dominated-by-china-requires-the-largest-production-increase-of-any-battery-mineral/) needed for batteries. The country so dominates the supply chain that global prices typically rise each winter when cold temperatures force a single region, Heilongjiang, to shut down production, said Tony Alderson, an analyst at a price tracking firm called [Benchmark Mineral Intelligence](https://www.benchmarkminerals.com/).

Some forecasts say graphite demand, driven by growth in electric vehicles, [could rise 25-fold](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary) by 2040. Amid growing U.S.-China political tensions, supply chain experts [have warned](https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/graphite-shortage-ev-electric-vehicles-supply-chain/626870/) about the need to diversify America’s sources of graphite.

Last year’s climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, [written in part](https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/policy-brief/clean-vehicle-tax-credit-new-industrial-policy-and-its-impact) to wrest control of electric vehicle manufacturing from China, is accelerating that search.

For new electric cars to qualify for [a $3,750 tax credit](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409) under the act, at least 40% of the value of the “critical minerals” that go into their batteries must be extracted or processed domestically, or in countries such as Canada or Mexico that have free-trade agreements with the United States.

That fraction rises to 80% in four years.

Graphite One is one of just three companies currently advancing graphite mining projects in the United States, [according to the U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-graphite.pdf). And company officials are already marketing their graphite to global electric vehicle makers.

But when they presented their preliminary plans to Tesla, “they said, ‘That’s great, we are interested in buying them, but we would need to write 40 contracts of this size to meet our need,’” Schaffner, the Graphite One vice president, said at a community meeting this year, [according to the Nome Nugget](http://www.nomenugget.com/news/graphite-one-sets-sights-bigger-mine-originally-proposed).

In response, Graphite One is now studying a mine that could be substantially larger than its original proposal.

It’s too early to know how, exactly, the mine’s construction could affect the surrounding watershed. One reason is that the level of risk it poses is linked to its size, and Graphite One has not yet determined how big its project will be.

While graphite itself is nontoxic and inert, the company also hasn’t finished studying the acid-generating potential of the rock that its mine could expose — another key indicator of the project’s level of risk. Stronger acid is more likely to release toxic metals into water that Graphite One would have to contain and treat before releasing it back into the environment.

One fish biologist in the region [has also said](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991738-norton-sound-bering-strait-regional-comprehensive-salmon-plan_-phase-ii) he fears the mine’s construction could negatively affect streams flowing out of the Kigluaik Mountains, though Graphite One officials disagree. The streams’ cool water, according to Charlie Lean, keeps temperatures in the shallow Imuruk Basin low enough to sustain spawning salmon — a critical source of abundant, healthy food for Brevig Mission and Teller residents.

Graphite One plans to store its waste rock and depleted ore in what’s known as a “dry stack,” on top of the ground — rather than in a pond behind a dam, a common industry practice that can risk a major breach if the dam fails.

But experts say smaller-scale spills or leaks from the mine could still drain into the basin and harm fish and wildlife.

“There is always a possibility for some sort of catastrophic failure. But that doesn’t happen very often,” said Dave Chambers, president of the nonprofit [Center for Science in Public Participation](http://csp2.org/), which advises advocacy and tribal groups across the country on mining and water quality. “There’s also a possibility there will be no impact. That doesn’t happen very often, either.”

Anthony Huston, Graphite One’s chief executive, said his project will incorporate local knowledge and protect residents’ subsistence harvests.

“We are completely focused on making sure that we create a stronger economy, and the entire Bering Straits region, and all of Alaska, for that matter. And that’s something that this project will bring,” he said in an interview. “But it will never bring it at the expense of the traditional lifestyle of Alaska Native people.

### A way of life at stake

There are no Teslas in Brevig Mission or Teller, the two Alaska Native villages closest to the proposed mine.

To get to the communities from the nearest U.S. Tesla dealership, you’d first board a jet in Seattle. Then you’d fly 1,400 miles to Anchorage, where you’d climb into another jet and fly 500 more miles northwest to Nome, the former Gold Rush town known as the finish line of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.

A 70-mile gravel road winds northwest through tundra and mountains before dipping back down to a narrow spit on the Bering Sea coast. The road ends in Teller, population 235, where most residents lack in-home plumbing — let alone own electric cars.

If you need a bathroom here, you’ll use what’s known as a honey bucket.

Brevig Mission, population 435, is even more remote than Teller. It sits across a narrow strait and is accessible only by boat or plane.

The region’s Indigenous history is memorialized in the 1973 book “[People of Kauwerak](http://www.alaskool.org/native_ed/historicdocs/people_of_kauwerak/kauwerak_pp.htm)” by local elder William Oquilluk. It documents the founding of Kauwerak, an Iñupiaq village by a sandbar near the Imuruk Basin’s innermost reaches.

The area was chosen, according to the book, for the same reasons it’s treasured now: abundant fish and birds, berries and moose, even beluga whales. Kauwerak became one of the Seward Peninsula’s largest villages before it was abandoned in the 19th century, as residents left for jobs and schools.

Whalers, then gold miners, brought profound changes to the Indigenous way of life on the Seward Peninsula, especially through the introduction of pandemic diseases. One outbreak of measles and flu, in 1900, [is thought to have killed](https://www.jstor.org/stable/986355?read-now=1&seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents) up to one-third of residents in one of the region’s villages. In Brevig Mission, 72 of 80 Native [residents died](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/health/dr-johan-hultin-dead.html) from the 1918 Spanish flu.

Today, the miners and whalers are gone. In Teller, the population of 250 is 99% Alaska Native.

Four in 10 residents there live below the poverty level, and a typical household, with an average of three people, survives on just $32,000 a year, according to census data.

At the community’s main store, the shelves are completely barren of fresh fruits and vegetables. A box of Corn Chex costs $9.55, and a bottle of Coffee-Mate runs $11.85 — more than twice the Anchorage price.

Residents can buy cheaper groceries in Nome. But gas for the 70-mile drive costs $6.30 a gallon, down from $7 in July.

The high cost of goods combined with the few available jobs helps explain why some Teller and Brevig Mission residents are open to Graphite One’s planned mine, and the cash income it could generate.

As Ayek, the 82-year-old subsistence fisherman, pulled his skiff back into Teller with a cooler of fish, a man a little way down the beach was slicing fresh sides of salmon.

Nick Topkok, 56, has worked as a contractor for Graphite One, taking workers out in his boat. As he hung his fish to dry on a wood rack, he said few people in the area can find steady jobs.

“The rest are living off welfare,” Topkok said. The mine, he said, would generate money for decades, and it also might help get the village water and sewer systems.

“I’ll be dead by then, but it’ll impact my kids, financially,” he said. “If it’s good and clean, so be it.”

Topkok also acknowledged, however, that a catastrophic accident would “impact us all.”

Many village residents’ summer fishing camps sit along the Tuksuk Channel, below the mine site. Harvests from the basin and its surroundings feed families in Brevig Mission and Teller year-round.

“It’s my freezer,” said Dolly Kugzruk, president of Teller’s tribal government and an opponent of the mine.

Researchers have found all five species of Pacific salmon in and around the Imuruk Basin. Harvests in the area have hit 20,000 fish in some years — roughly 30 per fishing family, according to [state data](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23989887-2021-annual-management-report-norton-sound).

At [a legislative hearing](https://www.akleg.gov/basis/Meeting/Detail?Meeting=SCRA%202018-02-27%2015:30:00) several years ago on a proposal to support Graphite One’s project, one Teller resident, Tanya Ablowaluk, neatly summed up opponents’ fears: “Will the state keep our freezers full in the event of a spill?”

### Gold Rush prospector’s descendants would reap royalties

Elsewhere in rural Alaska, Indigenous people have consented to resource extraction on their ancestral lands on the basis of compromise: They accept environmental risks in exchange for a direct stake in the profits.

Two hundred miles north of the Imuruk Basin, zinc and lead unearthed at Red Dog Mine have generated more than $1 billion in royalties [for local Native residents](https://alaskapublic.org/2021/12/09/many-see-red-dog-as-an-ancsa-success-story-what-happens-when-the-ore-runs-out/) and their descendants, including $172 million last year. On the North Slope, the [regional Iñupiat-owned corporation](http://asrc.com/) receives oil worth tens of millions of dollars a year from developments on its traditional land.

The new [Manh Choh mine](https://manhchoh.com/) in Alaska’s Interior will also pay royalties to Native landowners, as would the [proposed Donlin mine](https://www.novagold.com/properties/donlin_gold/overview/) in Southwest Alaska.

No such royalties would go to the Iñupiaq residents of Brevig Mission and Teller, based on the way Graphite One’s project is currently structured.

The proposed mine sits exclusively on state land. And Graphite One would pay royalties to the descendants of a Gold Rush-era prospector — a legacy of the not-so-distant American past when white settlers could freely claim land and resources that had been used for thousands of years by Indigenous people.

[Nicholas Tweet](https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/tweet.php) was a 23-year-old fortune seeker when he left Minnesota for Alaska in the late 1800s. His quest for gold, over several years, took him hiking over mountain ranges, floating down the Yukon River by steamboat, walking hundreds of miles across beaches and, finally, rowing more than 100 miles from Nome in a boat he built himself.

Tweet settled in Teller with his family, initially prospecting for gold.

As graphite demand spiked during World War I, Tweet staked claims along the Kigluaik Mountains, and he worked with a company that shipped the mineral [to San Francisco](https://dggs.alaska.gov/webpubs/usgs/b/text/b0692.pdf) until the war ended and demand dried up.

Today, Tweet’s descendants [are still in the mining business](https://aws.state.ak.us/OnlinePublicNotices/Notices/View.aspx?id=204110) on the Seward Peninsula. And they still controlled graphite claims in the area a little more than a decade ago. That’s when Huston, a Vancouver entrepreneur, was drawn into the global graphite trade through his interest in Tesla and his own graphite-based golf clubs.

News of a possible deal with Huston’s company arrived at one of the Tweets’ remote mining operations via a note dropped by a bush plane. They reached an agreement after months of discussions — sometimes, according to Huston, with [16 relatives in the room](https://issuu.com/stocknewsnow/docs/micro-cap-review-magazine-3).

So far, the Tweet family, whose members did not respond to requests for comment, has received $370,000 in lease fees. If the project is built, the family would receive additional payments tied to the value of graphite mined by Graphite One, and members could ultimately collect millions of dollars.

Bering Straits Native Corp., owned by more than 8,000 Indigenous shareholders with ties to the region, recently acquired a stake Graphite One’s project — but only by buying its way in.

The company announced its $2 million investment this month. The deal includes commitments by Graphite One to support scholarships, hire Bering Straits’ shareholders and give opportunities to the Native-owned corporation’s subsidiary companies, according to Dan Graham, Bering Straits’ interim chief executive. He declined to release details, saying they have not yet been finalized.

As they considered the investment, Bering Straits board members held meetings with Brevig Mission and Teller residents, where they heard “a lot of concerns,” Graham said. Those concerns “were very well thought through at the board level” before the corporation offered its support for the project, he added.

“Graphite One is very committed to employing local workers from those villages, to being as transparent as possible on what the development is,” Graham said.

Graphite One officials say they have work to do to ensure the region’s residents are trained for mining jobs in time for the start of construction. The company had a maximum of 71 people working at its camp this summer, but Graphite One and its contractors hired just eight people from Teller and Brevig Mission. Sixteen more were from Nome and other villages in the region, according to Graphite One.

Company officials say they have no choice but to develop a local workforce. Because of graphite’s relatively low value in raw form, compared to gold or copper, they say the company can’t afford to fly workers in from outside the region.

Graphite One says it’s also taking direction from members of a committee of local residents it has appointed to provide advice on environmental issues. In response to the committee’s feedback, the company chose not to barge its fuel through the Imuruk Basin earlier this year; instead, it flew it in, at an added cost of $4 a gallon.

Since Graphite One acquired the Tweets’ graphite claims, progress on the development has been slow. But now, escalating tensions with China and the national push to Americanize the electric vehicle supply chain are putting Huston’s project on the political fast track.

### ‘We don’t have a choice’

In July, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski boarded a helicopter in Nome and flew to Graphite One’s remote exploration camp overlooking the Imuruk Basin.

A few days later, the Alaska Republican [stood on the Senate floor](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5077358/user-clip-senator-murkwoskis-g1-mention) and brandished what she described as a hunk of graphite from an “absolutely massive,” world-class deposit.

“After my site visit there on Saturday, I’m convinced that this is a project that every one of us — those of us here in the Congress, the Biden administration — all of us need to support,” she said. “This project will give us a significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on imports.”

U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and GOP Gov. Mike Dunleavy [have all expressed](https://www.sullivan.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/alaska-delegation-hails-375-million-grant-for-graphite-one#:~:text=Project%20Will%20Restore%20Domestic%20Production,)%20to%20Graphite%20One%2C%20Inc.) support [for the project](https://gov.alaska.gov/alaska-governor-mike-dunleavy-applauds-37-5-million-grant-for-graphite-one/).

Graphite One has enlisted consultants and lobbyists to advance its interests, according to [disclosure filings](https://disclosurespreview.house.gov/ld/ldxmlrelease/2023/Q2/301487093.xml) and [emails](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991185-graphite-one-email-redacted-n-herz) obtained through public records requests.

They include Clark Penney, an Anchorage-based consultant and financial adviser with ties to the Dunleavy administration, and Nate Adams, a former employee of Murkowski and Sullivan who’s worked as a lobbyist in Washington, D.C.

Murkowski has said the mine will reduce dependence on foreign countries that lack America’s environmental and human rights safeguards.

“Security of supply would be assured from day one, and the standards for the mine’s development and operation would be both exceedingly high and fully transparent,” Murkowski wrote in [a letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991186-murkowski-g-1-letter) to the Biden administration in 2022.

The Defense Department, meanwhile, announced its grant of up to $37.5 million for Graphite One in July. This month, the [company also announced](https://www.graphiteoneinc.com/graphite-one-awarded-us4-7-million-contract-by-u-s-department-of-defenses-defense-logistics-agency-to-develop-graphite-based-foam-fire-suppressant/) it had received a $4.7 million Defense Department contract to develop a graphite-based firefighting foam.

[In a statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23991201-dod-statement), a department spokesman said the July agreement “aims to strengthen the domestic industrial base to make a secure, U.S.-based supply of graphite available for both Department of Defense and consumer markets.”

In Teller and Brevig Mission, Graphite One’s opponents have noticed how the electrical vehicle transition seems to be driving interest in the mine planned for nearby.

As the project gathers outside political support, some village residents said local attitudes have been shifting too, in response to the company’s offers of jobs and perks.

Tocktoo, the chief of Brevig Mission’s tribal council, said resistance in his community has diminished as Graphite One “tries to buy their way in.”

The company awards door prizes at meetings and distributes free turkeys, he said. Two years ago, the company gave each household in Brevig Mission and Teller a $50 credit on their electrical bills.

The project, though, remains years away from construction, with production starting no earlier than 2029.

Before it can be built, Graphite One will have to obtain an array of permits, including a major authorization under the federal Clean Water Act that will allow it to do construction around wetlands.

And the project also faces geopolitical and economic uncertainties.

At least last year, Graphite One was tight on cash. It had to slightly shorten its summer exploration season because it didn’t have the money to finish it, company officials said at a public meeting this year.

And while Graphite One is counting on a partnership with a Chinese business to help set up its graphite processing and manufacturing infrastructure, the partner company’s top executive [has said publicly](https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/08/06/chinas-graphite-grip-graphite-one-sunrise-new-energy/) that U.S.-China political tensions may thwart the transfer of necessary technologies.

Murkowski, in an interview at the Nome airport on her way home from her visit to Graphite One’s camp, stressed that the project is still in its very early stages.

The permitting process and the substantial environmental reviews that will accompany it, she added, will give concerned residents a chance to pose questions and raise objections.

“There’s no process right now for the public to weigh in. And it’s all so preliminary,” she said. “When you don’t know, the default position is, ‘I don’t think this should happen.’”

But opponents of the project in Brevig Mission and Teller say they fear their objections won’t be heard. Lucy Oquilluk, head of a Teller-based tribal government, said she feels a sense of inevitability.

“It just feels like we have nothing to say about it. We don’t have a choice,” Oquilluk said. “They’re going to do it anyways, no matter what we say.”

177qwt1,Arizona... slowly becoming EV friendly,"I have to commend Arizona for improving EV charging across the state.  And not just for Tesla but for us lowly CCS vehicles too.

I tried out the high speed chargers in Sedona last year.  This year I plan to check out the new chargers at the Grand Canyon.  Even little towns like Superior have an EV charger on main street.  This really opens up the opportunity for tourists to visit your beautiful state.  Which in turn brings in a lot of cash to the AZ economy.

1783gbv,About all those Tesla chargers showing up,"You've probably seen Tesla chargers showing up all over, especially at Wawas above the canal.  And they are often empty and you're like WTH?  

Tesla is opening up their network to other car manufacturers in 2024 so this build out is getting ready for that. Also more and more EVs are expected to be produced so demand will be going up soon.    

A lot of the chargers have a sign on them that say general parking OK with a time limit (see pic).  So yes, it's OK to park in them briefly, but it'd be nice if there are other open spots to use them first. But sometimes there's just no other options. Like the Wawa in Brookside.  Not many parking spots there at all and in the morning can get pretty crowded there. 

https://i.imgur.com/opUiuuq.png

So if a Tesla owner gets upset, just point to the sign and smile. 

Just please don't be like this guy.

17a10gi,CCS Charging in Great Falls Montana...,"OK guys.  Here's my problem.  There's no DC CCS charger in Great Falls Montana.  Think you could fix that up for me?  :)

If somebody were in Canada and wanted to drive their EV down the I15 to Arizona... can't do it. It's just a bit too far from Coutts to Butte.  270 miles.  Theoretically the I5 can do 303 miles.  And it might be OK in summer but in winter you don't have full range.  Plus I like a bit of a buffer.  It just wouldn't be safe to push it like that.

There's a Tesla Supercharger in Great Falls but without any high speed CCS charger that route is blocked for regular cars like the Ford lightning, Mustang Mach E or Hyundai Ioniq 5.

There are chargers all around.  Pretty much everywhere.  But not Great Falls.  You have to detour to Kalispell then down to Missoula and back over to Butte when you can get back on the I15.  Which adds 3 hours to the trip.

Just so you know, this is not normal.  There are CCS chargers literally everywhere all over North America.  It's just weird to find a charging desert on a major interstate.

Ya ya... first world problems and nobody likes EVs... I get it.  And that will change in 2025 when Tesla chargers open up to the rest of us.  Maybe sooner if Town Pump comes through with promised chargers in Great Falls.  Still...

17h0egq,Texas: Where the American Dream Is Being Crushed by Brutal Energy Bills,"Delwin Goss, a 72-year-old resident of Austin, Texas, had been proud of never paying more than $70 on electric bills despite keeping the temp at 72 degrees. Now, he keeps his house at 80 degrees and tries to use less energy, but his costs keep rising. In August, his bill was $124 — double what he’s averaged the past 15 years. 

Goss says that increase has happened primarily in just the last two years, and it makes him fear for his ability to stay in his home, particularly when housing costs are on the rise due to an influx of new residents from other states. Since the pandemic, he has seen the nearby opening of Tesla’s Gigafactory and Oracle’s headquarters. The city council recently green-lit [a plan](https://www.kvue.com/article/money/economy/boomtown-2040/council-approves-smaller-lots-plan/269-ed6df3be-5d42-41ee-bbbd-d4af3d6f2c50) for developers to build more homes on smaller lots, paving the way for more density.

“They say it's to make it more affordable, but it's having the opposite effect, because now it's a great investment property,” Goss said. “When I hear my city council members say I live in a growing, thriving, exciting community, all I can think of is overpriced, overcrowded with a very low public safety focus, because the renters just don't care as much.”

Throw in high electricity bills, and many, already over-stretched Texans are finding it too much to handle.

A series of infrastructure improvements in the state in the past two years have been passed down to consumers, who are experiencing higher and higher bills in the wake of hotter summers, colder winters. The wave of new residents to the state has further inflated both the cost of living and residents’ ability to move to a more affordable home — displacing the Texans who have lived in the state for decades.

17j2vu6,Come on Kingman!,"The other day I was traveling from Canada down to Vegas then on to Kingman and finally down to Phoenix in an EV.  Quite the fun experience.  I had zero trouble until I hit Kingman.  I pulled right in but instantly a big line-up formed.

Considering Kingman is where pretty much every EV needs to charge while traveling from Las Vegas to Phoenix, you would think it would have lots of charges, right?  I mean it's even home to the Route 66 Electric Vehicle Museum.  But nope.  Not so much.

I didn't check out the Tesla station but I'm going to assume it was up and running well.  They usually are.  Sadly the main EV charger for non-Teslas is run by Electrify America and they are usually not so good.  The station has 4 chargers and previously 2 of them were 350kw, one was a 150kw and one was a 50kw.

When I got there, the 350's were all running in reduced power mode at 50kw.  I'm assuming this has been the case for a while now because in the EA app the chargers were officially listed as 50kw.  My EV took 68 minutes to charge.

One thing I noticed, a commercial EV truck was parked at one of the chargers.  The drivers told me that it takes about 1 1/2 hours to charge and can only go for about 100 miles.  That's a stupid truck in my books but if these things are going to start showing up we are going to need a lot more chargers and fast.

Long story short, if Arizona is going to continue to be a major tourist destination in the coming years, and EVs are going to continue rolling out like crazy, Kingman needs better EV infrastructure.

18eism5,Loop Roadtrip: Anchorage to Fairbanks to Anchorage in Mid-September 2024,"My fiancé and I are doing a fun glacier elopement mid-September near Anchorage. Post-elopement, we'd like to drive up to Fairbanks and the surrounding area. Looking at car rental costs, obviously a one-way rental is huge fee and I'd rather spend that money just driving more! I've read a few threads on traveling from Anchorage to Fairbanks along AK-3, but I'd like some advice/feedback on other half of the loop back from Fairbanks to Anchorage.

* Fairbanks through Paxson to Anchorage. AK-2 S to AK-4 S to AK-1 S
* Fairbanks to Tok to Anchorage. AK 2 S to AK 1 S

Our timing isn't really planned out yet so a few days for driving is fine. I like to have control over the pace and I feel like a car will give us some extra freedom that the train or a quick flight wouldn't. 

My fiancé would also prefer an EV (Tesla) but the route seems super sketch for charging (it's slow or non-existent), but if we should stop overnight this may be a non-issue since the car can charge. I'm also unsure if the temperatures in September will have a negative affect on the battery. For a gas vehicle, I've read enough that I'll be planning out where to stop for gas. I'm thinking a full size sedan with AWD will work?

If there are any recommendations for nature stops or good food, please include those! (I'm willing to adjust a route for an absolutely must-try restaurant.) Thank you!

18mcc5p,Electric Vehicle Excise Tax Credit Question,"Update 2/13: Got my check!  I recommend texting the Tesla support number and ask them for your dealer's title clerk or DMV Operations Specialist.  I texted them twice over two weeks and got them to refer me to the Rockville location one.  That person then emailed me my pdf packet of registration documents.  I emailed those to the DMV excise tax email.  

Despite no confirmation response and repeated phone calls with no way to confirm that it was what they needed, two weeks later I got a check in the mail from the comptroller for the $3k!

Original post: I'm sorry if this question is better suited for another subreddit.  TLDR: I am trying to get the $3k Maryland Excise Tax Credit, but I am being ghosted and don't know what I did wrong.

I purchased an electric vehicle back in July and tried to submit a claim at end of August for the $3k Maryland Excise Tax Credit.  I believe I submitted everything needed (the VR-334 form and the window sticker), but I was told via email from a rep that my dealership needed to submit the titling paperwork.  When I went to the dealership they said everything was complete on their end.

Over a three-month time frame, I would get slow responses from the representative at the MVA.  I asked exactly what form was needed from my dealership, but they would never tell me exactly.  I was able to speak to her over the phone, but she still couldn't tell me exactly what form was missing.  We already received the license plate for the car and the actual Certificate of Title.  The car is fully paid off.

Fast forward to today, and I've had no response to the last four emails I've sent to the rep.  I tried calling the MVA directly and the customer rep I spoke to had no idea what to advise.  She wasn't able to give me a direct number to call their department either.

193jpgf,Grand Canyon trip in an electric vehicle?,"Hello! My friend and I are planning a 3-day trip from Phoenix to visit the Grand Canyon in March. Our preliminary itinerary is Phoenix - Sedona - Grand Canyon - Flagstaff - Phoenix, stopping overnight in Sedona, Grand Canyon village, and Flagstaff. We're planning on taking it pretty slow and easy.

We were looking at car rental options and the EVs (not Tesla) were significantly cheaper... like half the price. So we are quite tempted despite the initial ""no"" reaction to bringing an EV on a long road trip. By looking at sites like chargehub, it looks like there is decent charger coverage along the route, and we will look for hotels that provide chargers, however I've read just because a site has one doesn't mean it's working or available.

Does anyone have actual experience trying to charge along this route? Overall does renting an EV seem like a good idea for an itinerary like ours? I saw lots of EVs in Phoenix last time I was there, but I'm not sure what the experience is like once outside the city.

Update: Thank you for the replies everyone! There seems to be mixed views, if I had to generalize it seems people who own or drive EVs often feel good about the trip and people who don't have cautioned against it, and access to the Tesla supercharger network will make it much easier. Since they won't guarantee a Tesla (it could also be a Polestar), looks like maybe we're better off with gas this time around. :)",arizona,https://www.reddit.com/r/arizona/comments/193jpgf/grand_canyon_trip_in_an_electric_vehicle/,1/10/2024 21:28,24,61,arizona

Day 1 - Fly into Anchorage and rent a Tesla. Skip getting supplies here because I don’t want to weigh down the Tesla.

Day 2 - 4  - Drive to McCarthy - tour mines etc. use the locals road since I’ll need to charge the Telsa and don’t feel like walking over that bridge. Stock up on supplies at local Walmart. 

Days 4 to 6 - Drive to Bethel and tour the restaurants. Potentially go farmigan hunting. Attempt to win gold at the Yup'ik dance off.

Days 6 to 7 - Stay at the Igloo hotel and then make my way to North Pole to meet Santa. Rent a motorcycle in Fairbanks for the next trek up north.

Days 7 to 9 - travel to up Deadhorse and stock up on groceries. Heard the food in Coldfoot is amazing

Days 10 to 14 make my way down back down south. Drive the Alaska Marine Highway to Juneau and Ketchikan and then back track through Valdeez and Girdwood to airport.

Any tips to improve?

After that it was clear sailing down to Missoula where we spent the night.  It's a bit frustrating to see 8 empty Tesla Superchargers that Elon hasn't opened up to non-Tesla vehicles.  But he says we can use them in the first part of 2025.  If he doesn't change his mind.  Time will tell.  Anyway there is an Electrify America station at the Walmart so no big deal either way.  I even got a car wash across the street.

The next morning was was pretty cold but the car has no problems starting or heating up.  We were on our way.  

Two things sort of kill EV range.  One is cold (check) and the other is speed.  The speed limit in Montana, as you know, is 80mph.  Plowing through that much wind resistance at these low temps is going to cut your range.  We were getting only about 2.2 miles / kWh.  That left me with about 150 miles of range instead of the usual 200 - 280.  But since each charger is no more than 100 miles from the next, it wasn't an issue.

We charged up in Butte and another charge in a cool little nowhere town called Dell - Population 35.  Weirdly Dell has some of the nicest and fastest chargers we encountered on the whole trip.  If you aren't into EVs this will mean nothing to you but here I am in the dead of winter in nowhere Montana pulling 236kw.  Crazy fast.

Note the two numbers?  9 min to 80% but 30 min to 100%?  My car charges super fast up to about 80% and then slows way down.  That last 20% takes quite a while.  That's the same for a cell phone or lap top.  Because of this, I usually only charge up to 80% unless I absolutely need the extra range.  Managing your charging can make a huge difference on your total trip time.  Most of my stops are between 8 and 20 min depending on the speed of the charger and how far it is to the next charger.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jlfbbsvofocc1.jpg?width=2252&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=010c977c06a9084b23513401d7c6c343839046f9

Anyway... that's about as exciting as it gets.  Hop in, drive, charge, done.

EVs aren't perfect.  You can't haul a cattle trailer or offroad in them.  They have limited range, especially in the winter.  They cost about $10K more than a similar gas car.  All true.

But they have advantages too.  They are lightning fast.  Quiet.  Smooth.  The interior heats up super fast.  If you charge at home they cost maybe $5 to fill up.  And you never need an oil change again.

So EVs have pluses and minuses.  But driving through Montana in the winter in an EV is seriously no big deal.  

We continued on through Utah and Nevada, visited CES2024.  Fun trip.  Here's a nextgen model of my car they are working on.  Cool seeing it turn it's wheels to 90 degrees and drive sideways.

So maybe an EV will work for you.  Maybe not.  Drive what you like.  Personally I'm done with gas and I'm never going back.

19am08q,Question About Mountain Driving Tesla Model 3,"Hey everyone,

So I'm planning a road trip in early March with a couple of friends. We are going to be going up to southwest North Carolina in the southwest mountains west of Asheville.

I have a 2023 M3 RWD with the stock tires, and it would be 3 of us in the car with luggage.

According to historical weather trends, it will be around 40-50F at that time, so efficiency should be pretty good. 

The concern aside from the mountains is the only reliable charger we will have access to is the 110V outlet at the house. Then, there are some 3rd party chargers in the area, but we all know their reliability can be questionable. No superchargers within 60 miles of the place.

What I want to know is **whether this is feasible**.

We will be driving around the local area, not usually much more than 20 miles one way.

We will also spend a good amount of time at the house since we can find plenty of enjoyment there. May even stay in for whole days at a time.

This will be a 5 day stay, but arriving late the first day and leaving early the last day.

We would prefer to take the M3 because of comfort, tech, safety, etc., but have a gas car as a backup in case it's just not doable.

19bevqn,National Grid Smart Charge EV Program,"Hello,

I just wanted to confirm my understanding of this program to help myself and others who might be having the same questions. 

Just bought 2 Tesla’s and wanted to install a wall charger at home. From the national grid program website, made it seem like the Tesla wall charger was ineligible with the program. Upon further reading, I believe simply linking my Tesla account with the MA Smart Charge app will allow for the rebate, regardless of what charger is being used. Seems like they monitor when the vehicle is being charged from the third party API provided by Tesla. 

So again, while it doesn’t list the Tesla wall charger as a compatible charger, the Tesla model Y is a compatible vehicle. Just link the Tesla account with the Charge Smart MA app, and you should qualify for the off peak rebate. 

Please let me know if I’m understanding this correctly (someone currently on this program).",massachusetts,https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/19bevqn/national_grid_smart_charge_ev_program/,1/20/2024 15:59,6,16,massachusetts

AUSTIN, Texas — A Tesla employee from Minnesota was arrested on Sunday after posting on X, threatening to kill Elon Musk and President Biden in Texas.

According to an arrest affidavit, 31-year-old Justin Mathew McCauley posted the following threat on social media:

>***I will arrive in Texas, where the war has began on many fronts*** u/X***,*** u/Tesla  
>  
>u/JoeBiden u/X u/Tesla ***@ Elonmusk, I am planning to Kill all of you***

McCauley’s wife got in touch with the police department in Rogers, Minnesota and said he left for Texas and was “never coming back.” She said he left his cell phone behind so police would not be able to track him.

The court document said McCauley encountered law enforcement in Oklahoma on Friday and said he wanted to speak with the president. When asked why, he reportedly replied, “wouldn’t you want to talk to the president if you knew you were going to die tomorrow.”

On Sunday, deputies stopped McCauley on I-35 in Austin. He told them he planned to go to the Telsa gigafactory to contact Elon Musk.

 He was arrested and charged with Terroristic Threat. 

﻿ ------======\*\*\*\*\*\*O\*\*\*\*\*\*======------ 

McCauley is looking at a minimum of Class A Misdemeanor, with up to a year in prison; or a Class C Felony, which is two to ten years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

Either way, McCauley's life, as he knew it, is essentially over.  A charge of ""Terroristic Threat"" will relegate him to low-paying jobs with little job security -- but Whataburger and Dairy Queen are always looking for fresh talent!

1armdfh,SunCommon / SunPower solar system removal for roof replacement,"SunCommon installed a rooftop solar system for us in 2012, and we lease it through SunPower, a California company. Our roof was damaged during the January windstorms, and we have contracted with a roofer to have it replaced this spring. However, we've hit a roadblock with SunPower who is responsible for removing and re-installing the solar panels (at my cost unfortunately). They require that the work be done by an authorized dealer and the nearest one is in Michigan. Their only listed Vermont dealer, Grassroots Solar, was acquired and no longer works with them. SunPower doesn't work with them anymore either, although they are trying to help. SunPower has strung me along for a month now and my frustration is at the boiling point.

Are there any other SunPower customers out there who have faced a similar scenario? Any advice? If I'm really stuck, should I reach out to state agencies (DPS, AG) or my representatives? My major concern is that if water damage occurs, my insurance agency might not pay because I didn't complete repairs in a timely manner.

1b0guum,January Sports in Florida - good stuff on and off the beaten track,"Hey there from Ireland,

A few buddies and I are looking at rectifying some post-Christmas blues and escaping the Winter weather in Ireland and coming over for some sports and r'n'r in the second week of January 2025.

We like our football and like the look of the CFB semi final Orange Bowl at the Hard Rock on Thu 08-Jan (we can see we can put deposits down for tickets there) and perhaps another pro and college sports at the weekend. 

That's also super wild card weekend in the NFL, so the possibility of a home Fins game, or at a long drive push, the Bucs or Jags would be a bonus. From experience picking up playoff tickets isn't always as hard as people think. Or, depending on what way the schedules fall, a b-ball or hockey game.

Here's where I am asking for some local expertise, is there anywhere worth heading to for a fun sports experience that we're not thinking of. We'd rather a great college hoops game than an anodyne local corporate franchise experience, and aren't ruling out most of the state (We'll likely fly into Miami and out of Orlando). No limit to the sport or the level it's played at!

TL;DR -> Sports in January, what's fun?

Thanks,

I'm in Saco, and from the few people that came out to look at my breaker box, they mentioned I had room for one without upgrading my service.  Normally it's something I could do myself, but it's in a condo and the bylaws state that electrical work must be done by someone licensed.

Every car company sucks in their own way, just Elon makes Tesla an easier target... Henry Ford supported the Nazi's, Toyota is trying to kill all EV legislation, GM tried to roll back fuel standards... Lets just accept that all car companies are evil and move on...

The only viable competitor for us is the Ioniq 5 but it's almost $10k more and I'm really interested in the OTA updates, charging stations, and the auto pilot feature that comes with the Tesla. 

I'm looking for feedback from any Tesla owners on their experience owning a Tesla in Maine. Any general feedback would be great but I also have specific questions. 

Specifically: 

1) Where does your new Tesla arrive? I see there is a Tesla test drive in Portland, a service center in MA and a dealer in NJ. I'm seeing mixed information on where you pick the car up. Can I just have it delivered to my house? 

2) How has your maintenance/service experience been? I'm in coastal Maine Ellsworth/MDI region, does mobile service exist for us?

3) If you were to buy a car again, would you buy a Tesla or something with a ""traditional"" dealership model and why?

4) How is charging in Maine? This is one of the main reasons we are considering Tesla over other manufactures, I've heard  and seen that the 3rd party charging stations are really inconsistent and we'd prefer having access to Teslas' network. I know Ford is coming online with this soon but the Mach E's driving/auto pilot is not as good.

* Enphase IQ8PLUS Inverters

As we work through the transition, the current TOU program will be closing, and BGE will be unable to issue bill credits after March 31, 2024, for customers enrolled through their Enel X (JuiceBox) chargers.
However, if you have an EV from one of the following manufacturers, you may be eligible to switch your TOU enrollment to your vehicle and upgrade to the evPulse platform now to ensure no disruption in your bill credits:
•	Hyundai
•	Kia
•	Lexus
•	Tesla
•	Toyota
UPGRADE ENROLLMENT
If your EV is not listed and you would like to continue participating in the program, you must have a ChargePoint or Wallbox charger. If you own one of these Level 2 chargers, you can enroll through the same link above. Follow the instructions attached to complete your registration.
If your EV is not listed and you want to be alerted if program enrollment expands to additional vehicle manufacturers, please join the waiting list. You will be prompted to provide your vehicle/charger make and model, ZIP code and email address.

1buzf2e,NC Solar PowerPair Program,"Heya! I generally just review posts but don't post anything, however, I am anxious to know if anyone has any insights on this new PowerPair program that Duke is introducing.

I have always been interested in installing solar and nearly pulled the trigger last year, but in end withdrew since prices just didn't seem appealing enough. This year, one of the vendors hit me up and gave me a new quote with the introduction of the PowerPair Program. It looks pretty promising at first glance since if you're installing a Tesla Powerwall 3 (13.5kW), you will be getting $9k as rebate back in addition to the 30% Federal tax credit. This is assuming your application gets chosen when the application opens between May 10 - June 7.

After digging in deeper, I discovered there are some bullsh\*t behind the program since Duke Energy is involved. I read about participants being split between two cohorts. Cohort B seems to be getting short end of the stick since Duke can discharge up to 80% of battery you accumulated at X days throughout the year. I believe during Winter they can discharge it 18 times, whereas the other seasons, they can discharge it up to 9 times. You CAN switch cohorts after 12 months have surpassed, but limited to availability. You must also agree to be in this program for 10 years otherwise there is a penalty for early breakup. I am not sure what happens if you need to sell your house to relocate one day. One can only imagine they should have a clause for such scenario although I doubt you'll get away clean without a hitch.

Bottomline: Do you folks still think it's worth it? Any feedback on this Cohort structure? I personally think you're still getting a free battery out of it so it can't be that all bad.

1cabst1,Tesla uses new state law to sidestep Austin regulations at gigafactory,"Tesla Inc.’s huge electric vehicle factory in eastern Travis County will no longer be subject to city of Austin environmental regulations after the company used a new state law (Senate Bill 2038) to have the property removed from the city’s extraterritorial jurisdiction.

The controversial law — which some municipalities are challenging in court — took effect Sept. 1 and allows landowners on the fringes of major cities to petition for such removal, freeing them up to develop with fewer restrictions. The law, know as Senate Bill 2038, was approved last year with strong support from developers and others in the business community because it enables them to build and operate under more limited county and state oversight.

Lauren Middleton-Pratt, Austin's director of planning, has said previously that the city has no discretion when petitions are received for properties that meet the law's removal criterion.

That was the case with Tesla, which submitted a petition Feb. 8 for nearly 2,100 acres along State Highway 130 and the Colorado River, including the gigafactory site, and was formally notified by the city on March 8 that its property met the requirements and would be released. An initial petition from Tesla was denied because some of the boundaries outlined in it were only partially within Austin's extraterritorial jurisdiction, according to the city.

Tesla representatives didn't respond to a request for comment.

Tesla petitioned to remove nearly 2,100 acres in eastern Travis County from the city of Austin's extraterritorial jurisdiction. This map outlines the acreage that will no longer be subject to Austin's environmental rules.

More than a dozen municipalities around the state have joined forces in a legal challenge to the new law — including Hutto and Lockhart in the Austin area — that they say strips their ability to effectively regulate land they might one day annex into their city limits and also jeopardizes the health and safety of nearby citizens and the environment.

Austin hasn't joined the lawsuit. But city officials concurred with the view that releasing property from its extraterritorial jurisdiction has consequences for current and future residents.

""Removal of an area from the ETJ impacts both the ETJ and the city because development in the ETJ is subject to limited subdivision regulation and regulation of water quality and flooding issues, all of which impacts people in both the ETJ and the city itself,"" said Shelley Parks, a city spokesperson, in a statement. ""While in the ETJ, the city can enforce environmental and flooding standards.""

When Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) first announced plans for its gigafactory — a 10 million-square-foot facility that employed almost 23,000 people as of Dec. 31, although the figure is likely lower now because of recent layoffs — CEO Elon Musk said he planned an environmentally friendly ""ecological paradise"" at the location along the banks of the Colorado River.

“We are going to make it a factory that is going to be stunning,” Musk said during the 2020 announcement. “It is right on the Colorado River. So we are actually going to have a boardwalk where there will be a hike and biking trail. It is basically going to be an ecological paradise — birds in the trees, butterflies, fish in the stream. And it will be open to the public as well, so not closed and only open to Tesla.”

But those public amenities have yet to materialize, and Musk regularly chaffs at regulations — environmental and otherwise — at the multiple companies he runs, including Tesla, SpaceX and The Boring Co. Among them, he has railed against labor laws, Covid-19 restrictions and efforts to rein in the scope of Tesla's autonomous vehicle technology, sparred with the Federal Aviation Administration over launch delays at SpaceX's facility in South Texas and lamented permitting requirements he blames for slowing Boring Co. projects.

Given that context, Austin attorney and environmentalist Bill Bunch said it's no surprise that Tesla has opted to leave the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction.

“Part of him moving the (Tesla headquarters) here was because of conflicts with California environmental and labor standards,"" said Bunch, executive director of the Save Our Springs Alliance.

He said the city of Austin never should have extended water and sewer utilities to the Tesla factory without annexing it first or at least getting an assurance from the company that it would agree to be annexed in the future.

""We don’t have any business extending utilities to people who don’t want to meet our standards or pay our taxes,"" Bunch said. “With annexation, obviously that’s your tax base, and then you get to regulate and make sure their development is appropriate to city standards for the environment, health and safety.""",texas,https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2024/04/22/tesla-gigafactory-etj-austin.html,4/22/2024 14:11,280,65,texas

2. How easy will it be for a foreigner (me) to use the EV charging network(s)?

1civc7a,FPL Solar Together - thoughts?,"Last week I had a door to door salesman talk to me about solar panel installations. I wanted to go solar, so I listened to the conditions. Basically, you either pay 28k upfront for panels you own, or a fixed bill forever of 171 dollars for renting them with no upfront cost - which sounded great. The catch was (found out after some beating around the bush) if you ever decide to opt out, or sell the house and the new owner doesn't want to buy their services, you need to pay the equipment off. Not at 28k but at 52k instead. 
Buying them would be the best bet, but it takes 11 years to see a ROI, and then after maybe a decade of free energy, they could possibly need to be replaced. Plus hurricanes, insurance premiums covering the equipment etc., it all sounds like a headache. So that crashed and burned.

Today I finally enrolled into PFL Solar Together. I know it's a different concept entirely. I will never see the benefits of having panels installed on the roof. But I'm curious as for how it's going for those who have been in the program for a while. At break even cost with the fee/credits, I'd rather use solar of course.

1d9d2wm,VinFast from the perspective of a Vietnamese,"I am Vietnamese, from the homeland of VinFast. As you may know, VinFast plans to build a factory in your state. As a Vietnamese, of course, I want a domestic brand to succeed, but their products must truly be good and ensure user safety. There are some issues I would like to raise about VinFast through news channels inside and outside the country:

1. A Vietnamese blogger named Sonnie Tran, when analyzing debts and unclear aspects of VinFast's deals, was arrested by the police and interrogated for 35 hours, had personal belongings confiscated, and later harassed by the police. He is currently seeking asylum abroad.
2. A Vietnamese YouTuber filmed a review clip highlighting the flaws of their ICE vehicle and got sued by Vinfast. I don't understand how a company can sue their own customers.
3. ""Chairman Vuong always talks about building this car brand as an expression of patriotism and his great responsibility to this country. Some high-ranking politicians, when speaking at events organized by VinFast, also say that this is a patriotic gesture. They make it seem like us Vietnamese people not buying or criticizing their cars means we don't love our country! It's truly unreal statement... (You can find this in the Facebook groups of VinFast owners).""
4. ""At the annual shareholder meeting, the company's CEO stated that Tesla's stock has declined because VinFast has taken away their market share. Yes, a 6-year-old startup is talking about taking market share from Tesla in the US. Can you even imagine that?""
5. It's not difficult to find images of VinFast's faults in Vietnam, especially on social media platforms like X, Reddit. Social media platforms with high usage in Vietnam like Facebook, TikTok, or popular forums those images have been removed within a short time. In Vietnam, some TikTok channels pointing out Vingroup's (Vinfast's parent company) wrongdoings have no ""follow"" capability. Articles from mainstream channels  reporting on faulty VinFast cars are deleted within a few hours of posting.
6. VinFast's financial situation is really not good, financial reports show that they owe billions of dollars. Their stocks on the Nasdaq exchange have lost about 80-90% of their real value since their first listing. There have been large fluctuations in a short period (recently). Many investment websites have raised suspicions and advised against investing in this stock.
7. Most details on VinFast cars are supplied from China. Some suppliers have no experience in producing those parts before. When they exported 999 cars to the US, there was a large recall due to software errors. The website of the US NHTSA has many reports of ADAS system failures causing the car to veer out of its lane. One of those errors is suspected to have caused a fatal accident involving a family of four in the US.
8. The supporting industry in Vietnam is not really developed. While the automotive industry needs a lot of support from it, VinFast is producing electric models very quickly according to the industry's criteria. Many reviews show that manufacturing at VinFast is rushed in time and budget, leading to skipping safety checks before bringing them to the market.
9. I know Toyota also has faults and massive recalls. But, the CEO still knows how to apologize. I've never heard the chairman of VinFast apologize or acknowledge any issues with the cars; he always talks about a bright future and dismisses media suspicions about VinFast's capabilities as unfounded. He even suggests that those efforts are aimed at sabotaging VinFast.
10. There are several cases of fatalities within the country where families are forced to remain silent because, under the legal framework enforced in Vietnam, they have almost no choice but to remain silent and accept compensation when dealing with the largest private conglomerate in the country.

You may call me an anti-fan and a self-deprecating/hate person. That's okay, it has nothing to do with the facts that I've stated above.

Wouldn't let me pass at all and was brake checking me. I was in a rush this morning because my grandpa had an accident and was rushing to the hospital... 

Yesterday I was turning onto 17 from east Rutherford at a light with 4 lanes I was the second left most lane turning left and the left most lane had a trashy lifted pickup truck also turning left. The jerk almost ran me off the road twice down 17 N because he couldn't stay in his lane making the turn but had the nerve to flip me off when he was the one at fault! 

Last week my town has a busy roundabout and some idiot kept letting people enter the roundabout even though they had a yield and we were actively in it with the right of way... what the actual fuck! 

Last month someone was actively trying to crash into me on 95 N like as if they were in a bumper car... don't even get me started on all the people driving in the emergency shoulder as well when there's traffic.

1dglav9,FPL Time of Use vs Net Metering explained with real numbers,"So I got Tesla Solar panels installed on my house in Florida. Chose Tesla on price, they were half the cost of other solar quotes.

So, they put me on Net Metering. It was pretty good, but I thought it would be better, if I were on Time of Use(TOU), because you can program your Tesla system to use Solar/Batteries during the day, and recharge from the grid at night. I got it all programed, and switched to TOU. Then I got a huge surprise on my first bill. They do not give you credit for any of the electricity you generate and charge you for every kilowatt you use during the off peak time. They also do not discount it as much as they advertise I used 0 kWh of on peak electricity. As of the time of this writing, June 2024, I am paying just over 7 cents per kWh. Reading their information, I was under the impression it would be 2-3 cents per KwH. So I used 1500 kWh and my bill was $115. With no credit for the electricity that I am generating during peak hours. I generated 1026 kWh, so with Net Metering, I would have paid \~11 cents per kWh, subtract out the 1026 kWh I generated and my bill would have been $55 on Net Metering, so TOU cost me Double what net metering cost. Also, you can conserve your batteries and not use your batteries at all on Net Metering, just use Solar and Grid power and save your batteries for power outages. I read that they have another TOU plan, where they pay you 2.7 cents per kWh you generate. If I were signed up for that, I would have gotten $27-$28 off of my $115 bill, still a complete and total waste. What is the point of trying to help reduce the load on the grid if FPL does not incentivize you to do so? They actually charge you more to help them reduce the load on the grid during on peak. Also, have an electric car(not a Tesla), which I was going out of my way to charge at night, but again, what is the point if there is no incentive to do so? Someone at FPL needs to realize that they could severely reduce daily demand if they would make TOU a viable deal. As it stands now, they literally charge you 2x more to use power during off peak times. So, conserve your batteries, don’t let them discharge at all, unless the power is out, charge your car during peak times, put as much a strain on the grid as you can, until FPL realizes they need to do something about it. They could reduce the peak daily power needs if they would incentivize us to do so, but they are choosing not to, and that is on them.",florida,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/1dglav9/fpl_time_of_use_vs_net_metering_explained_with/,6/15/2024 16:06,3,4,florida

I look at ASU in Arizona, if you look at their football stadium parking lot, it's all shaded spaces with solar panels on top. We have plenty of sunlight, so why not abuse that?

Now, companies will balk at the cost of that. So why doesn't the state help subsidize that? I think thats a better use than continually being behind on energy availability. For the big data centers, or companies like tesla that move out here. If they have giant parking lots that people have to walk from their car to the building, we could utilize that to help power that data center with its own power grid per se.

1dm5wfb,Home solar - how did you calculate number of panels/cost? Which company (Oahu)?,"Not sure if better to post this here or in a solar subreddit, but I’ve seen good home solar questions answered here before


I’m looking to add solar to my house, we have a lot of info including breakdown of hourly usage, and now trying to figure out how many panels and whether or not I should go with battery. 
The new HECO programs seem to not incentivize battery as much as a few months back. I’d be fine with a battery if ROI is under about 10 years. Right now I’m don’t care as much about backup power, I have a generator if necessary. 
I think I just need to calculate how much energy I need during day, that’s one set of panels, then based on HECO export and night/evening rates calculate how much I need to generate to get credits for night usage -seems the credits I have to generate 2.5X to 4X energy to upload that I can get credit for (so if I use 15 kWh, I’ll have to upload about 50 to get the 15 I think). 
Then compare that with cost of battery and the fact I can get close to 1:1 storage  to usage ratio. Then compare upfront and monthly cost.

Is that right? So far I’ve talked to Tesla this past week and they couldn’t help me with any of these calculations, seems they’re roughly guessing and aren’t familiar with HECO programs. Also called HECO, not much help.  Is there a solar company that will go into this level of analysis with us to help get the proper number of panels and whether or not we should get a battery?

1dt6vgt,Coal rolling truck. Barre to StJ.,"So this afternoon, some ""brave"" individual decided to roll, brake and block in a 23 year old in a Tesla. He drove recklessly in order to blow as much crap as possible. When she tried to pass he would gas it to make sure she couldn't. She was finally able to get around him at which point he rode her back end all the way to StJ.

Congrats on your cool points I guess.

How many cool points do they hand out for harassing a sick kid driving the car her dad died and left her? Her dad bought it when he beat leukemia in 2016/2017 and when cancer came for him again in 2020 he wanted her to drive his car. She has the same genetic condition that killed him. (We didn't know he had it when we had her.) And it's left her with a belly full of scars and an insanely withdrawn nature.

Red cab truck with low wooden bed slats and a temp tag. Already reported it for all the good that will do. 

I fought for years to keep her dad alive. Fight to keep her as healthy as possible so she can have a good quality of life. I do not have a withdrawn nature. Not by a half measure.

1duvgfx,JCP&L rates question ,I’m looking at my electric bill and I’m trying to understand the rates. Consumed 2010 kWh and billed $383. Which brings the kWh cost to about $0.19. My concern is the EV charging (we just installed Tesla wall charger). I don’t see any money savings with this rates. On paper it’s still cheaper than gas but if we take into account the more expensive EV insurance (in my case +$800 per year compared to gas vehicle or 6000 miles with $3.39 per gallon and 27 mpg for comparable sized car) I’m not so sure anymore… How much do you guys pay for your kWh while EV charging at home?,newjersey,https://i.redd.it/30mwgeuxsead1.jpeg,7/4/2024 2:01,16,11,newjersey
1dwanq3,Tesla/EV Ownership in Apartment Complex Questions,"Thinking about a Model 3 Long Range but live in an apartment complex. 

Live in Northwestern NJ.

Have a long commute, on average about 75 miles round trip a day with no way to charge at work, or at home.

Would almost solely rely on Superchargers at supermarkets and the such.

Was hoping to charge every 3 days on average.

Is this reasonable? 

I especially worry about winter/cold weather range and charging more than anything.

Costs on average for charging at stations in North and Central NJ?

Also what kind of insurance quotes am I looking at for good coverage with reasonable/normal deductibles? Mid 40’s, squeaky clean abstract going back 10+ years besides a seatbelt ticket 8 years ago, great credit for reference.

1dzca6b,E-car station Charging ,"I have a e-vehicle and really love it. I also have a charging station at my home with solar.

Out of curiosity today, I pulled into a charging station at a local shopping station and checked the charge rate it was $0.49/KwH. I looked up the conversion to miles and it looks like the it’s less than 3 miles per 1 KwH. $5 for 30 miles?  Is that correct or am I doing the math wrong?

I know there a ton of free charging stations out there as well but noticed that most of them are 2 hours max which typically only gets you 50 miles (25 miles/hour).

What are locals doing without  a charging station at their home?

If the state is truly trying to go green, the charging stations need to be more accessible, convenient and affordable.

1e78mp0,DDS Thomaston Road Test 7/18/24,"Hey all, took my road test at the Thomaston center yesterday (passed!) since everything within 2hr of Atlanta was booked to Aug, Sept, even Oct 😭. Writing this post here for future drivers so y'all can get a gauge of how it'll be at this specific location (may apply to others too?) since I wasn't able to find anything recent online for myself before the test.



Preliminary:

* You will not need to do another vision test or written test if you hold a permit already. You will need to take a new photo.
* Thomaston is a virtual testing site, so they will place a camera on your dash and call you to give instructions. If you can connect your phone to the car speakers/mic that helps a lot.
* Your examiner sits in the booths where all the customers are, so you will overhear conversations and the examiner may speak to other employees. Just be aware that not everything they say pertains to your road test, so don't stress over that.

Parking maneuvers test:

* In the back of Thomaston (behind the Do Not Enter signs) they have a space with cones set up. You can probably check this ahead of time on Google Maps satellite view.
* This consists of parallel park, then back-in park, then drive straight backwards. There was no 3 point turn tested.
   * Parallel parking gets two tries. I was able to ""wiggle"" my car into the spot, and if you have a back-up camera (or a 2D visualization with the Tesla) you can use those, just make sure you also make it obvious to the examiner that you're checking mirrors and looking back, even if you're just pretending. Smaller cars are obviously easier to park.
   * Back-in parking gets one try only and is a **90 degree** maneuver here. You can **not** do a 45 degree maneuver, as you're not allowed to cross into the left lane. Make sure you know your car's reference point. Also, there's only one parking space so if you're used to using the parking lane marking two spots down as your reference... well, find a new one or you'll have to wing it like I did.
   * Driving backwards is fairly simple, just drive backwards as straight as you can in your lane. Back-up camera also makes this easy, just as always check your mirrors (or pretend).
   * DO NOT HIT ANY CONES

Road test:

* The Thomaston area is pretty quiet so there isn't too much traffic. The fastest road you'll drive on is the divided highway in front of the DDS center (you'll cross it twice) at \~40 mph.
* The route does a little loop out the front and takes about 10 minutes total. I'm actually pretty sure I didn't see a single traffic light during the test, just stop signs.
* These are rural-ish roads and not always well marked or visible, so pay attention to your examiner's instructions or you may miss a certain left turn at the start. 
* There's a strip of residential area, and I would advise going \~20mph here, no more than 25. The examiner did ask me what my speed was here.

  
All in all wasn't too bad. Just make sure you signal often and correctly, including when getting into a parking spot, and make a show of checking mirrors, behind, blind spot, etc. Good luck!",Georgia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Georgia/comments/1e78mp0/dds_thomaston_road_test_71824/,7/19/2024 16:58,10,2,georgia

1ekn3x5,Missouri 529 and other government sponsored savings plans.,"Traditionally a 529 is a great savings tool for parents sending their kids to college. Unfortunately, the 529 program sponsored by the state of Missouri is a collection of Vanguard mutual funds that are not exactly transparent in their holdings. You have to jump through hoops and do a lot of research to discover that most of the [20+ mutual funds](https://www.missourimost.org/motpl/fund/pricePerformance.cs) offered heavily rely on the so-called ""Magnificent 7"" stocks (Nvdia, Google, Meta, Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple). There's nothing wrong with investing in these stocks, but they're all in a similar basket of technology stocks rather than a variety of industries. 

Many of these mutual funds are simply collections of other Vanguard mutual funds bundled together, even though they hold many of the same companies. This gives the illusion of diversification. As we woke up this morning, many people weren't prepared to see this market correction, and many think they're protected with their ""diversified"" mutual fund portfolio. The Missouri Treasurer's office has done the citizens a great disservice by funneling so much college savings into a handful of stocks. Once this correction is over, Vanguard and Co will likely walk away with billions of dollars that exited people's savings funds. The money almost always flows to the top. 

I assume there are other savings programs for state employees that offer similar investment products. These could face heavy losses as well. 

I'd love to hear what others think, and any corrections if I'm off on my thought process. If I'm right, I hope people are able to view their holdings and take precautions.

1flu78t,Is Carmel IN The Best Place To Live In America?,"I went on Niche.com and found out that Carmel IN is ranked like #1 best place in America, only after a neighbourhood in Arlington VA.

I currently live in Cambridge MA, which I believe is one of the best places in MA, and even though rent is so expensive (luckily I live in one of the most affordable units where my 325 sqft studio next to Harvard only costs me $1650 per month as of 2024), Cambridge has world class institutions, decent public transit (by US standards), decent nightlife, tons of amenities/quality restaurants, and it is highly walkable with decent bike infrastructure (on par with many European cities but still behind Scandinavia/the Netherlands). Cambridge is also one of the safest cities of its size and its density in the US. Cambridge even has one benefit:

Its EV charging infrastructure

Many people would dream to easily charge an EV whilst renting a studio apartment

In Cambridge, despite the fact it is nowhere as easy as say, owning a single house with a garage, it is still nonetheless better than most other cities where you would have to drive to a Tesla Supercharger/EA and sit for 30 minutes each charge.

I am curious who here lives in Carmel IN and what your thoughts are because even though I have only visited Carmel IN once during a Chicago road trip in June and stayed there for a few hours, some of my pros and cons are:

Pros:

Affordable housing (I found some ranches for 320k and houses are generally big)

Decent public schools

Ok crime for a suburb

Proximity to Indianapolis

Debatable:

Diversity

Weather

Opportunities/traffic

Politics

Is it close to other major cities?

Cons:

Car centric, not really walkable

I am curious what your experience in Carmel is and if it stacks up anywhere close to Niches methodology of the ""best place""?

Been told that I would regret getting rid of my Tundra but the truth is I don’t even take it off-roading and a Tesla would provide the same things that an ICE vehicle would give me. We don’t rent so I could install the Tesla charger at home. I guess my question is do you regret going electric or do you enjoy your EV?

I've had portable A/C for about a year and just recently got Mini split for the past few month, thinking my bills will drastically go down. But it had actually increased. We run A/C about 12 hours a day. Barley used appliance. Washer dryer about 3 times a month.

I charge my tesla but according to the app, i've used 312 kwh in the past 31 days.

I called HECO and they said the meter is accurate and there is nothing else they could do. But I feel like something is wrong. $900 for two people is really high.

My daily average KWH is from 62kwh - 69 kwh

Does the bill sound about right?

What should I do to dive deeper?

how can I find out what is pulling so much electricity?

Update 12/8

I contacted my electricity company, HECO for the third time and they actually sent someone down to do a little investigate. He took the meter back to his office and replace a new one. Came out the meter was working perfectly fine. He told me everything looks about right.

I also got an electrician to come out to help take a look. But he was pretty useless. He took a look at my breaker and told me everything looks good.

My electricity use has been looking about the same. I can't find any reason why it is so high. It fluctuate from about 50kwh to high 60s kwh. From what i'm told 15-20kwh is a big difference when we do the same thing every single day. We don't do anything different per day. We run the same amount of A/C, we cook, shower same amount as any other day. I don't know why it fluctuate like that. When I click on daily, I would see the most energy use is at 1am-2am. Half my family is asleep. Weird how those time are being used the most.

1gbxvmq,Republican Candidate Jim Griffin (running against Tim Larson for Congress) had a debate last night. He believes power plants are useless since humans only need to stick an antenna on their heads to generate electricity. Also rambled on about Chinese spy ballon when asked about abortion. ,"Jim Griffin is the GOP’s nominee for the first congressional district which is currently held by John Larson. Griffin hails from Bristol and is a massive conspiracy theorist, among them are:  
-Believing JFK was not assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald  
- Claiming there’s a cure to cancer but people don’t feel like releasing it  
-Accusing democrats of hiding the cures to cancer, multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson’s disease and that they don’t need medicine to be cured  
-The cost of living crisis is a scheme created by the Federal Reserve to brainwash people into supporting the globalist “New World Order”  
-All natural disasters/weather can be controlled using technology created by Nikola Tesla  
-Climate change can be ended by using technology created by Nikola Tesla  

A debate was held last night at Trinity College for this race. Griffin spent the entirety of it to peddle discredited conspiracy theories and didn’t seem to understand that he had to answer the questions asked to him not  needlessly rambled. When asked about electric bills, he said that Eversource and United Illuminating and all forms of power plants (fossil fuel/renewable) are useless since we can stick a “condenser, alternator, and an antenna” on our heads to harvest electrical energy around us. When asked about abortion, he instead talked about the Chinese balloon incident a few years ago and how it proved that the federal government committed treasonous acts. This prompted the moderator to try to shut him up.  

Although the state Republican Party is in relative shambles, they should at least have some sort of vetting process so they can stand some tiny chance of actually winning. The fact that this crackhead was able to secure this nomination, even if it’s a race in a safe Dem seat, is an indictment on how the CT GOP has an “I don’t give a fuck” mentality when choosing people to represent them. It just seems like these republicans are in a contest to out-clown each other rather than being serious.

I am a future international student, most likely in Indiana. I'm looking for some specific cars, so if you know if anything like this is easy to find in Indiana I'd appreciate your help.

I'm looking for any eastern european garbage I can find. My top pick would be the Zastava Yugo, but those are very rare in the US. Something like a Lada Riva would also be fun, but I doubt I could find anything wholesale that's in good condition and finding the parts for repairs is likely impossible in the US.

Then, some more realistic options. Possibly a Golf mk1, or a Skoda Felicia. Both very common cars in Eastern Europe.

How hard would it be to find any of these cars in Indiana? Do you recommend anything in the same spirit but easier to get? Also keep in mind, I'm not looking for just a bad cheap car, so something like a peugeot 207 or opel astra wouldn't be what I want, even though they are common in eastern europe as well.",Indiana,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiana/comments/1gjefps/i_am_looking_for_shit_cars/,11/4/2024 13:39,0,30,indiana

1grdkqo,Duke Energy Billing Periods duration/dates,"Has anybody been able to predict the billing **meter reading dates** from Duke Energy?

**TL;DR**: I am programming a dashboard that says how much my current usage at this hour is costing me accounting for monthly minimum charge, basic customer charge which are variables that depends on accurate next/past reading date

I am programmatically calculating the ""next bill"" by reading off my Tesla Solar system's net grid export kWh and I need a reading date to know when to cut off reading for the month.

Based on my past bills, the reading periods have lasted anywhere between 28 days and 32 days and vary on day of the month and day of the week. Is it even possible to calculate 2-3 months ahead what these reading dates would be?

I am looking just for the reading date (ie. **Nov 12** in the example here, but wanted for month after etc.), not date the bill PDF would be generated/emailed.

Basically predicting any of these bill dates, service periods, and number of days for future months.

The Duke Energy rep I chatted with were not able to provide any formula to calculate these beyond ""check your bills' next meter reading date"" which will at best tell me one month ahead.

I want to ideally avoid running OCRs on PDFs from my inbox, and if it can be calculated without reading the bill every month would be great.

PS.  
I wouldn't really need to know next reading period if there weren't monthly minimum charge and basic customer charge that I needed to accommodate for to actually have an accurate ""cost per hour"" dashboard.

I’m moving from British Columbia, Canada, to Reno Nevada in February 2025 for work, and I’m trying to prepare for the process of importing my car into the U.S.

I own a 2024 Tesla Model 3 Long Range, purchased in Vancouver, BC. I believe it was manufactured in Tesla’s Shanghai factory before being imported into Canada. I’ve been doing some research but still have a few questions:
	1.	Import fees: What kind of costs should I expect, such as customs duties, taxes, or other charges?
	2.	Compliance: Does my Tesla need any modifications to meet U.S. regulations, like emissions or safety standards?
	3.	Registration and insurance: How does the process work in Nevada, and are there any potential challenges for a previously Canadian vehicle?
	4.	Timelines: How long does the import process usually take? Should I start early, or can this be done after I arrive?
	5.	Any additional tips: Are there any less obvious steps I should be aware of when bringing a Canadian car to the U.S.?

1hcclbv,Drone situation and a couple of theories,"So, i know everyone is collectively losing their marbles over this whole drone/UAP situation. With sightings around Morris and Monmouth counties, there are a few theories to these sightings. Again, these are just theories but collating all the information based on location and what people in high places do not say about it: There are three hypotheticals to what the flying f*ck (literally) is going on.


1: Classified DOD testing of next-generation drones or UAV’s for future conflicts involving near peer (modern military) threats. (Most plausible)

There are three known major US military installations within NJ. Picatinny arsenal, Joint Base McGuire Fort Dix, and Sandy Hook Naval Station. Out of these three locations there may be testing of these reported UAP’s for near peer conflicts in the coming years. Due to NJ’s varying topography and biomes, it provides a good testing ground for future development of reconnaissance craft or combat capable drones. Also may explain why our government isn’t saying much about the whole situation.


2: Private company/corporation performing research and development for aerial unmanned courier/transport vehicles.

Drone technology has advanced vastly in the past 20 or so years. Using that in the private sector may improve deliveries and or declutter our roadways for the foreseeable future. I wouldn’t put it past a tech giant like tesla or amazon to be doing such a thing.


3: A foreign adversary is launching these UAP’s off of the coast in international waters for intelligence reasons (Least likely).

We have a-lot of entities and regimes who don’t like the US. Be it so far as to say we stick our hands in everyone’s cookie jars. Although highly unlikely, it may be possible that this could be the case.

Discuss below. Again these are theories, i hope I’m wrong about the 1st and 3rd. ",newjersey,https://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1hcclbv/drone_situation_and_a_couple_of_theories/,12/12/2024 3:58,0,13,newjersey

1hdjhs8,"Don't Take Your Children (or Work) at This Daycare, Seriously.","HI! I once worked for a lady in Mid-Missouri and made this throwaway account so she can't send her cronies after me or anyone I know, but I'll make sure to post this daycare's name in a photo because the owner is allegedly racist, and  very much ""I'm going to pretend to sue you"" happy. THIS Is **NOT** to bash anyone but I am tired of being kept silent about it and this HAS to be heard by more than just the local Facebook community/grapevine.

[ALLEGEDLY, she is notorious for deleting reviews and has her employees rate her company every time something \\""bad\\"" comes up](https://preview.redd.it/t6ekc6scpn6e1.png?width=662&format=png&auto=webp&s=725b4cd67bc4393dc527b054b2a2d090c2771400)

I worked here for a while and have seen first hand and heard things that are presumed to be alleged, I DO apologize for this long post! (And sorry there are at least 25+ ALLEGEDLY's in this post lmao).

I have heard allegations in the past that she charges Black families more money than the white families and that she never charges two people the same rates. She charges apparently over $900 per kid and only pays $12.30/hr (which I KNOW is common for daycares in the area) without sick-leave/pto. And if you ARE sick, you better hope she sends you home because I've witnessed teachers/floaters on the floor VOMITING and with a fever and they still won't send you home because they would rather not go into a classroom and help. And you also may not get all your hours on your check and if you were to question it, they would tell you that you had TOO many hours and they would send you home for the day. OH and she'll charge you a deposit fee and when I left, she charged me it TWICE on my check, only one was on the statement.

She recently sent out cease and desist letters to former employees and parents who have spoken truth about her on facebook about a thing she SAID to someone else (I'm not sure who even posted this to begin with but this is in fact her real account that she has since deleted because of the backlash) and in fact here is the ACTUAL post that was shared that she doesn't want you to see:

[This doesn't bother me personally, but what DOES bother me, if she is saying this about white people, what does she say about other races?!](https://preview.redd.it/47yee8kfon6e1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=952575858e80e03d2a7e65cbd4ec807cbd0d3158)

  
I have reported her to state before and they pushed my truth under the rug. She was found to be forging physicals and I have witness firsthand lies about children at her daycare about bites/fevers/sicknesses/anything and everything while working there. Children running out of food because the ""director"" allegedly doesn't want to run to the store to help feed the 100 children in the center properly because he doesn't want to leave his office. Taking over an hour to reply to an incident happening, not letting employees go to the bathroom, and sometimes even making you work over eight hours with only an hour break (Sometimes not even getting a break at all, which right now I know is legal in MO but will be illegal next year (? if they actually PASS IT)). 

  
I have heard too, ALLEGEDLY that if you were to PUT her down on your resume and your new employer would call, she will lie about you and say you were a terrible worker (and I believe this did happen to me, I just have no proof).

  
G.E and her son A.E. are total cronies and make over $2 Million a year while never paying employees on time, not caring about sick employees, make fun of their employees and customers, and does not pay employees for meetings. She allegedly overcharges military families as well and refuses to take fosters or state kids because she thinks they're below her (as everyone is if you're not rich like her and drive four or five new teslas and a brand new BMW).

When she opened a second location, she came up to various employees and said ""hey I used your application for the second location"" I reported this to state as well and they said ""nope, didn't find anything."" due to it being a verbal exchange there was no evidence even IF this event was a first-hand account. Along with this, when she was FOUND to be forging medical documents, none of us were made aware of this until someone stumbled upon the [violation](https://healthapps.dhss.mo.gov/ChildCareSearch/ViewInvPDF.aspx?LID=002964172&cid=116977252871) that they were supposed to tell everyone about but oddly...never did.  
She allegedly talks shit about parents to her employees by calling them every name in the book and will then turn to the managers of the daycare and say how she can't ""trust"" certain people and also call them names (I have seen these texts from former managers and they have told me IRL many stories that have allegedly occurred from G.E. and A.E. Once a manager posted a photo to the parents and G.E allegedly wrote ""who was the fucking idiot who posted that photo to the wrong fucking kid?""). 

She makes you sign fake NDAs (That were maybe two sentences long) and has you scared that if and when you leave, she'll come after you and in the C&D they said *""it's illegal to share private facts in the state of Missouri""* \--so yeah, don't be saying any TRUTH about her character or anyone else you know because ""it'S ILLegAL"".

  
IF you live near Ft. Leonard Wood or Osage Beach. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE YOUR CHILDREN TO THIS DAYCARE, she and her family are only in it for money and do not care about the safety of you or your children. She just cares about how much money you will put in her pockets. 

Again, I have **TRIED** to report her to the State but they told me both times that nothing was found and I fear this is because they may be forging more documents and emails (As allegedly her husband ALSO has once used a classified military email for personal attacks/issues in the past). So, she and her family are no strangers to lying/forging. 

**You can view all her violations here actually:** [**Waynesville**](https://healthapps.dhss.mo.gov/childcaresearch/Facility.aspx?LID=002964172) [**Osage Beach**](https://healthapps.dhss.mo.gov/childcaresearch/Facility.aspx?LID=003022973)

Again, sorry for the long post but this is something I really wanted to say and get out, we as Missourians shouldn't be wasting our hard-earned money on someone like this! Thank you for reading this, it feels wonderful to get this off my chest!

\--  
**TL;DR:** A daycare near Ft.

Looking for some advice on an alternative for electricity. It's hilariously expensive for my house!I bought my house last June on the Londonderry/Manchester/Litchfield border. 

I am very fortunate that my home came ready for the future. 

The entire house is considered a "" Residential Space Energy Efficient Home "" as the rep from Ever source put it. 

Electric baseboard heaters ( one for each room, including individual thermostats for each room ) 

Brand new polarized windows with new frames across the house.

3 year old upgraded General Electric 200AMP electrical panel. 

3 year old induction Samsung stove 

3 year old LG refrigerator. 

Oil drum has been removed. No septik. No well. On town sewage. 

My house is also southern facing. So the sun leans on my roof. 

I consider my self blessed & fortuante. Previous owners did me a huge solid here. Solar is the obvious option. What do you recommend? Leasing vs owning?. Which companies rock with New Hampshire & the wild weather we have up here? My bill last month with ever source was extremely high. My heaters cost a fortune to run! Yikes! 

We are attracted to Tesla because of how elegant the app & entire system is ( also the name ) but I am open to other companies. 

It seems that every week a solar rep is in my neighborhood trying to hustle for a sale. With last months bill now they have my attention. As I understand it, leasing means I don't get the $15K incentive. I am still willing to see the pros & cons of all of it.

“While Flex events can be a resiliency measure and can make a difference if that type of scenario occurs, these events are not currently being called to reduce the likelihood of an outage,” Tracy said.

Instead, the primary goal is to drive down energy costs the rest of the year, according to both PSE and the Department of Commerce.

“The concept of it is if utilities can trim even just a little bit of demand during periods when electricity use is at the highest, they can do quite well for customers by keeping prices down and also do a better job of making sure there’s enough power to meet customer demand during those periods,” Blackmon told McClatchy in a video call.

Blackmon said this is a relatively common strategy across a range of other industries as well.
“It’s not just utilities, there’s lots of systems out there that have to plan for the period when usage is at its highest, and that can end up meaning that you have some pretty expensive resources that you’re only using a very small amount of time over the course of a year or even multiple years,” Blackmon said. “So if you can flatten out the demand a little bit, you can save money and improve reliability.”",Washington,https://www.bellinghamherald.com/news/state/washington/article298205253.html,1/9/2025 21:38,31,15,washington

1i3u1hw,North Ferrisburg - Blue Tesla watching kids get on and off the bus. ,"A blue Tesla has apparently been watching my brother’s kids get on and off the bus for the past few weeks. They park two driveways down, just outside of where the parents can see when they are getting picked up in the morning. The bus driver had noticed them before and only said something about it today. 

They escalated today and attempted to enter the driveway this afternoon, and fled towards route 7 when the dog reacted. 

We found several footprints along the top edge of the road after, just outside of the range the dog can reach when he is hooked on his leash. They lead along the edge of the property and end near the mailbox at the side of the road.

1ievr37,"I have been wondering how a 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada would specifically affect Texas. So, of course O asked ChatGPT.","How a 25% Tariff on Canadian & Mexican Goods Would Impact Texas

Since Texas is the #1 exporting state in the U.S., a 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican goods would have major consequences for its economy. Texas relies heavily on trade with Mexico, making it one of the hardest-hit states.


1. Impact on Texas Trade & Jobs

Trade with Mexico & Canada

Texas exports over $375 billion in goods annually, with Mexico as its #1 trading partner (~$144 billion in exports).

Canada is the #2 destination for Texas exports (~$30 billion).

Imports from Mexico ($121 billion) and Canada ($21 billion) would become much more expensive.


Job Losses

Texas has over 950,000 jobs directly tied to trade with Mexico and Canada.

Many of these jobs are in automotive, oil & gas, agriculture, and logistics—all industries vulnerable to tariffs.



---

2. Impact on Texas Industries

🚗 Automotive Industry (Texas = 2nd largest auto-producing state)

Mexico is a major supplier of auto parts to Texas-based car manufacturers (Toyota, Tesla, GM).

25% tariffs would increase car prices and disrupt supply chains in San Antonio, Arlington, and Austin.

Job losses in auto manufacturing, trucking, and dealerships.


🥩 Agriculture (Texas = Top U.S. state for beef, cotton, and dairy exports)

Mexico buys billions in Texas farm products (beef, cotton, dairy, soybeans).

Mexican retaliation would hurt Texas farmers, leading to declining exports and falling farm income.

Texans would pay higher prices for Mexican imports (avocados, tomatoes, peppers, beer).


🛢️ Oil & Gas (Texas = #1 U.S. state for energy exports)

Texas imports crude oil from Canada and Mexico for refineries in Houston, Corpus Christi, and Port Arthur.

A 25% tariff would raise fuel prices, hurting consumers and businesses.

Mexico is Texas’ biggest buyer of natural gas, and retaliation could reduce U.S. energy exports.


🏬 Retail & Consumer Goods (Texas = Large import hub)

Texas imports clothing, electronics, and appliances from Mexico—all would become more expensive.

Retailers like Walmart, H-E-B, and Home Depot would see rising costs, leading to higher prices for consumers.


🚛 Logistics & Supply Chain (Texas = Major trade hub)

Ports of Houston and Laredo would suffer due to reduced trade.

Texas has the largest land port (Laredo) for U.S.-Mexico trade.

Tariffs would slow down cross-border trucking, affecting the 1.2 million trucks crossing the Texas-Mexico border annually.
---

3. Impact on Consumers & Cost of Living

Higher Prices for Texans

Cars, groceries, gasoline, electronics, and home goods would all become more expensive.

Border cities (Laredo, El Paso, McAllen) rely heavily on trade with Mexico—they would see the biggest price increases.

Job Cuts & Business Closures

Job losses in manufacturing, agriculture, trucking, and retail.

Small businesses relying on Mexican goods (restaurants, auto repair shops, construction) would suffer.

4. Political & Economic Fallout

Texas Republicans and business leaders would likely oppose tariffs, as Texas is a pro-trade, pro-business state.

Border communities (Laredo, El Paso, Brownsville), where economies depend on Mexican trade, would be hit the hardest.

Texas real estate & construction could also be affected if material costs (steel, cement, lumber) from Canada/Mexico rise.

---
Conclusion: Texas Would Suffer Major Economic Consequences

Biggest Impacts:

1. Job losses in trade, manufacturing, and agriculture.

2. Higher prices for food, fuel, and consumer goods.

3. Disruptions to Texas-Mexico trade at border crossings.

4. Hurt Texas’ oil & gas industry, increasing fuel prices.

5. Retail and small businesses would struggle with rising costs.

Since Texas relies more on trade with Mexico than any other U.S. state, it would be one of the biggest losers in a tariff war.

I'd love Maine to do that, too, but I don't know if we could afford it.

But what we could do is require any EV chargers in the state to accept all EVs.  People with teslas pay a fee to use those chargers and so would anyone else, so it's not like we'd be asking tesla to give free energy to anyone, just open up their chargers for everyone.  Maybe even let them charge a nominal additional fee (like $1 or $2) to use them for the first year or two.  Because they may need to add some kind of attachment to fit other vehicles.  

It would encourage EV sales, save the state (potentially) money for adding charging infrastructure and just be good for the state.

1ikd6i8,"From Senator Chris Van Hollen: Urgent Senate Update: Our Government Belongs to the American People, Not Elon Musk","
February 7, 2025

Urgent Senate Update: Our Government Belongs to the American People, Not Elon Musk

Over the past few weeks, we’ve seen unprecedented and illegal actions from the Trump Administration that are threatening our communities. That’s why I’m sending you another urgent newsletter update, following the one I sent Saturday and last week. I’m also providing constant updates on my social media accounts which you can find here: Bluesky, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Threads, Twitter/X. And you can share with us how Trump/Musk Administration actions are affecting you, by visiting my website here. We’ve already heard from thousands of Marylanders, and your stories will continue to help us fight back.  

We are witnessing the most corrupt bargain in American history. Elon Musk spent over $280 million to elect Donald Trump, and Trump has handed him the keys to the federal government. Together, they’re abusing their power to access sensitive personal information about Americans and to further enrich and empower the ultra-wealthy at the expense of the rest of America.   

Elon Musk is now staging a hostile takeover of virtually the entire federal government. This is no time for business as usual, and I can assure you I am fighting back with every tool at my disposal. One of those essential tools is stopping these illegal actions in the courts, and I’ve spent hours on the phone and in person with lawyers who are assembling and filing the cases to stop this illegal power grab. I am also doing everything I can to rally opposition to the Musk takeover and use the tools of the Senate to oppose Trump nominations and focus on the crisis at hand.   

Last weekend, we learned that Trump and Musk were working to shutter USAID. On Monday, they banned workers from entering USAID offices and doubled down on a foreign aid freeze that prevents patriotic USAID employees from doing essential and life-saving work around the world. Make no mistake: Elon Musk’s effort to dismantle USAID is a gift to China, Russia, and our other adversaries. Putin’s cronies immediately posted on X, “Smart move by Elon Musk.” This is not America First – it is America in Retreat. It has nothing to do with government efficiency and everything to do with aiding and abetting our adversaries. In fact, if you talk to American military leaders, they will tell you that USAID is an essential and cost-effective part of our overall national security and foreign policy strategy. USAID makes us safer by helping provide more stability and opportunity to very combustible parts of the world. And when USAID fights disease overseas, they not only save lives there, they also prevent those diseases from spreading here and harming Americans.  

Shutting down USAID not only makes us less safe – it’s also downright illegal. USAID is established by law. Presidents are not kings, and they don’t get to cherry-pick the law. And Elon Musk may get to be a dictator at Tesla – and he may want to play dictator in the nation’s capital – but he doesn’t get to shred the law.  

On Monday, I organized a group of my colleagues to go to the USAID Headquarters to stand with current and former employees against this illegal power grab. I was joined by over a dozen Senate and House members, and we attempted to go inside USAID to see first-hand what was taking place. We were barred from entering because of orders given by Musk and his cronies. When the Administration continued to double down on these actions, I joined even more current and former USAID employees on Wednesday, to speak out once again, and yesterday I made the case on the Senate floor.

What we’re seeing at USAID isn’t just a battle over providing critical foreign assistance to advance American interests and values across the globe – it’s also a test case for many of their other illegal efforts to take over our government. And just yesterday, we learned that Elon Musk and his cronies are planning to fire nearly all of USAID's 13,000 employees. Last night the American Foreign Service Association, American Federation of Federal Government Employees, and the nonprofit Democracy Forward filed a lawsuit to stop this cruel, lawless attack, and I am doing everything I can to support them. 

USAID is not the only place we’re witnessing Musk’s takeover efforts this week. We also learned that Trump has handed Elon Musk access to Americans’ personal, private data – ranging from your Social Security number to your bank account information. By providing Musk and his cronies access to the Treasury Department, he’s putting the confidential information of millions of Americans at risk.   

These systems are so sensitive that they are entrusted to the smallest possible circle of nonpartisan civil servants. Now, they’re in the hands of Elon Musk, an unelected billionaire, and his DOGE minions. While a court just restricted their use of this sensitive information, they can still do enormous harm to the privacy and other important interests of the American people.

To protest this unacceptable breach of Americans’ trust, on Tuesday, we rallied outside the Department of Treasury and called out the Trump Administration for giving away Americans’ most sensitive information. I am also using Senate hearings to raise the alarm about what is happening. On Wednesday, I asked bank executives at our Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee hearing if they would ever allow access to this type of information at their institutions, and they said ""no.” I also called on the Chair of the Committee to immediately hold hearings about this unacceptable breach of American privacy.

Unfortunately, USAID and Treasury are not alone. We’re hearing reports of many other agencies being raided by DOGE, including NOAA and the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services in Maryland, as well as efforts to completely hollow out the Department of Education and the Office of Personnel Management, which oversees more than two million federal employees. I’ll continue to speak out against each of these illegal efforts – for example, I joined a rally with teachers, education advocates, and others on Tuesday to stand up for our students and our public education system.  

We must stop this illegal power grab.  

Right now, our best recourse for immediate relief is through the courts. I’m grateful for the states, the federal workers’ unions, the nonprofits, and the democracy watchdogs who are suing Donald Trump for his illegal actions, and I’m engaging with these groups and doing everything in my power to support their efforts. We’ve already seen some courts put a stop to these illegal actions. The situation is evolving every day, but here’s the latest. Two cases filed against Trump’s funding freezes have resulted in temporary restraining orders against these actions. Another court blocked Trump’s attack on birthright citizenship. Additionally, a judge partially reined in Musk’s access to records at the Treasury Department, and yesterday a judge delayed his sketchy buyout offers for federal employees and will hold a hearing on Monday to review its status. To federal workers considering these buyouts, I once again urge you to proceed with extreme caution.

Baltimore City has also joined a coalition in a lawsuit against the Administration’s witch hunt against so-called “DEI” initiatives – an order so broad and undefined that it could freeze funding for everything from afterschool programs for kids to public safety. Federal employees have been put on leave and encouraged to report on their colleagues over “DEI,” including in one case for attending a training conducted during the last Trump Administration that was promoted by his former Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos.   

I’m heartened by the actions our courts have taken so far, and I’ll continue working closely to support these efforts. 

And while we’re not in the majority, I am also determined to fight back in the Senate with every tool we have. Without Republicans on board, we don’t have the numbers to stop Trump’s moves outright, but we can slow him down. That’s why I have said the Senate should NOT operate under business as usual. And that’s why I’m voting NO on Trump’s nominees. Along with Senator Brian Schatz, I’m holding up every Trump political nominee for the State Department – as well as other nominees – until Trump stops wrecking our government.  

For example, this week Senate Democrats held down the floor for 30 hours – the maximum time allowed under Senate rules – to delay the vote on Russell Vought, Trump’s nominee to run the Office of Management and Budget. I went to the Senate floor as part of this effort to make the case against Vought, who is a leading architect of Project 2025. At his confirmation hearing, I asked Vought if he’d follow the law—and he refused to say yes. That should be no surprise; he broke the law the last time he held that position.

Right now, I’m hearing from thousands of Marylanders who have been personally affected by Trump’s actions. Firefighters and small business owners who fear that federal resources will be ripped out from under them. Federal workers who fear being forced out of their jobs. Families terrified of losing their health care. I’m committed to fighting back for Marylanders each and every day. Again, if you are being harmed by Trump’s actions, you can share your story with me by clicking here.  

Trump and Musk are engaged in an illegal power grab, trying to accomplish through executive orders and other means what can only be legally achieved through congressional action. They want us to believe they are more powerful than they really are. They want us to think we can’t do anything about it. But it isn’t true. Together, we can and will keep fighting back.

1ikyrib,Outside the Murphy Meeting- Final thoughts,"Thank you to everyone that engaged with these posts in good faith- even the people I don’t agree with. 

The RSVP event had a line going around the school. Lots of people told me they didn’t have an RSVP, but no one appeared to be turned away at the door. Confirmation of that would be welcome. 

I arrived before 11am as MAGA was gathering in full regalia. Trump shirts, bullhorns, flags, drums, and snark. Many people in line brought signs and stared at the spectacle. Some spirited attendees had key words and favorite fingers to gesture at the streetside  show. An overwhelming majority of the attendees talked quietly among themselves and offered encouraging words. 

At noon, the Trump parade swelled to 40-50 people and advanced to heckle the waiting attendees. Some of the MAGA engaged in good faith conversation, but most were there to put on a show. 

20 or so people either drove in with the intention of a rally and/or stepped out of line to hold their ground against the endless stream of “this is Trumps America now”, “ I can afford a Tesla”, “are you being paid by an NGO”, “Racist Democrats founded the KKK”, “why is this meeting in white West Hartford”, etc. 

Both sides stood peacefully 99.9% of the time with some minor verbal flare ups that were quickly addressed by the 6 police officers on outside duty. 

When the attendees were inside and there was no crowd to watch the show, team MAGA packed up and moved on. I was somewhat surprised that one of the more vocal members of Team MAGA offered the remainder of their donuts to the Good Neighbors that stood in opposition. It suggests to me that the MAGA leadership knows this is a show. They seek the viral moment and attention and some of them go back to being normal people when the attention is gone. 

High points: 

The huge crowd of people that showed up to have a conversation with the Senators inside.

The 20 outnumbered people that quietly endured the barrage of bullhorn taunts with dignity and resolve. (I’m bringing earplugs next time)

Low points:

A small number of very mean spirited individuals in the MAGA camp that respond to pleasantries with taunts. They aren’t my favorite neighbors. 

Being out numbered 2:1 or more. My only consolation here was the crazy long line of people going into the building to participate in democracy outside of the voting booth. 

Final thoughts:
I will continue to attend protests. I’m not sure I would attempt to lead the charge again. I’m inexperienced, ill equipped, and my calls to action felt too ineffective/inefficient to rally a crowd of people to drown out a motivated Maga group. Frankly, we could have used more help. 

To the established organizations that I reached out to in an effort to rally support: If you can’t rally an additional 10-20-50 people in a moments notice after years of building a grass roots organization, what’s the point? Now is the time to be nimble and responsive.

[Edit 3] okay ive returned. I do want to talk more. No matter what, there is educational take aways from this and new resources Im learning about with each reply

With how gerrymandered our state gets. Our political and societal history over the last 4 to 8 years. 

How strong is Wisconsin going to have to be to see the current storms through? 
Ive asked people in other states and countries and the common mentality is that while diverse to an extent. Generally conservative. 

In the last two months, the shit that happens to our state has been amplifying and its feeling like were less a state of citizens and more a whippable lab rat for CEOs and Politicians and...if shit gets heavier, we ARE a very important state for US infrastructure mainly food supplies. 

We're about to get taxed out the ass. Elon is suing to get tesla dealerships in. Weve been gerrymandered to hell and back, and lobbied prey upon alchoholism to make money.

We are capable of being strong as a state, and neighborly to one another as citizens, but...its about to be really wild for us in the coming months and years.

How do we truly become ready and strong enough to tell those that want to take advantage, to fuck off and make it stick?

[Edit] I need to clarify too, im not just talking politically. Should, and knock on wood that it doesnt, the powers that be, constantly continue to piss on our northern neighbors. We're a target. We're 100% a first target. 

What would be our best course of action to keep ourselves safe and strong if that shit hits the fan?

1ipf9iw,Email response from Rep. Josh Brecheen regarding Elon Musk and DOGE,"Thank you for contacting me about Elon Musk. It is an honor to serve as your Representative for the 2^(nd) Congressional District of the great state of Oklahoma. I am thankful for this opportunity to hear from you.  



On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed an [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency/) officially establishing the Department of Government Efficiency as a “Temporary Organization” by renaming the previously established United States Digital Service (USDS) as the United States DOGE Service. President Trump’s Executive Order notes that DOGE’s main focus will be “modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize government efficiency and productivity.” President Trump further solidified DOGE’s status within his Administration on February 11, 2025, when he signed another [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-works-to-remake-americas-federal-workforce/) requiring that federal agencies “coordinate and consult with DOGE to shrink the size of the federal workforce and limit hiring to essential positions” 



President Trump also announced that [Elon Musk](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113472884874740859) is working as a [Special Government Employee](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-makes-musk-worlds-richest-man-special-government-employee-2025-02-03/), an official federal role similar to that of an advisor or consultant, and is being tasked with carrying out DOGE’s initiatives to “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.” I have personally spoken with Mr. Musk and look forward to working alongside him as a Member of the DOGE Caucus to focus on restoring funding priorities to solely constitutional initiatives.  \\Unfortunately, in recent days, many have attacked Mr. Musk and DOGE with [claims](https://www.aft.org/press-release/unions-sue-over-elon-musks-unprecedented-and-illegal-hack-americans-private-data) that they are launching an “unprecedented and illegal hack of Americans’ private data.” Despite this narrative being perpetuated by the mainstream media, there is no evidence that Mr. Musk or DOGE have accessed any data they do not have the authorization to view.



In response to questions about Mr. Musk’s authority within the Trump Administration, President Trump has [confirmed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuPr2-T_Z_U) that “He’s got access only to letting people go that he thinks are no good, if we agree with him and it’s only if we agree with him.” If you have concerns about Mr. Musk’s access to government data, I urge you to review DOGE’s official [website](https://www.doge.gov/) and [X page](https://x.com/DOGE), where the organization is transparently outlining every action it is taking to reduce wasteful federal spending.



As President, Donald Trump has Article II constitutional authority to appoint both Mr. Musk as a Special Government Employee and DOGE as an organization within the Executive Office of the President. It is important to note that President Obama originally [created](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2014/08/11/fact-sheet-improving-and-simplifying-digital-services) the USDS in a similar manner in 2014 “to improve the usefulness and reliability of the country’s most important digital services” by pairing “the country’s top technology talent with the best public servants.” By repurposing USDS to include DOGE, President Trump is simply updating the purpose of USDS to authorize Mr. Musk, today’s top technology talent, to ensure that taxpayer dollars are being spent reliably by the federal government. 



Since gaining citizenship in 2002, Mr. Musk has worked hard to create a better life for himself and has become one of the most qualified individuals to be tasked with streamlining spending and modernizing our federal government’s technological capabilities. Not only is Mr. Musk the owner of many successful businesses, including Tesla, X, and SpaceX but he has also long been considered a valuable federal defense contractor. Specifically, SpaceX, which “designs, manufactures, and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft,” has recently been [tasked](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1884365928038563880) by the federal government with rescuing astronauts stranded on the International Space Station. Mr. Musk’s professional success is inspiring and a true embodiment of the American dream. 



Unfortunately, the United States’ crippling national debt is poised to undermine the American dream due to the deficit and continued overspending that is causing inflation through the devaluation of our currency. Between 2021 and today, our currency was devalued by around 20%, meaning that Americans now have to spend $1 to purchase the same goods and materials that we could have spent approximately 0.80¢ for in 2021. To put this into perspective, the average family in Oklahoma is spending an additional[ $1,400 per month ($17,000 per year)](https://budget.house.gov/press-release/bidens-20-percent-inflation-tax-costs-american-families-over-17000-per-year) to afford the same goods and services purchased in January 2021.



If the American dream is to survive, Congress must enact real change and stop wasting taxpayer dollars. Since beginning his work with DOGE, Mr. Musk has identified many areas in which the federal government is wasting your taxpayer dollars, including spending:  



\- [$1.7 billion](https://www.npr.org/2014/03/12/287349831/governments-empty-buildings-are-costing-taxpayers-billions) per year on maintaining empty buildings

\- [$101 million](https://x.com/DOGE/status/1889105335991820585) on DEI training grants;

\- [$45 million](https://x.com/DOGE/status/1884612616347066536) on DEI scholarships in Burma;

\- [$28 million](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/21/world/asia/afghanistan-army-uniform-camouflage.html) on licensing fees for camouflaged Afghan National Army uniforms;

\- [$2.7 million](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Festivus-2023.pdf) on studying Russian cats walking on treadmills;

\- [$1.7 million](https://www.wrfalp.com/national-comedy-center-receives-1-7-million-grant-from-u-s-department-of-commerce/) on holograms of dead comedians; and,

\- [$500 thousand](https://x.com/DOGE/status/1887277159947117027) on NASA Politico subscriptions.



As your Representative, I am committed to reducing the size of our federal government and eliminating unconstitutional federal spending. I am confident that with Elon Musk at the helm, DOGE will be the catalyst of great fiscal renewal for our nation.  \\Thank you again for contacting me about Elon Musk.

1it5r3d,This bumper sticker says it all…,"What the f*** is going on with Vermont? It seems like those of us who were born in Vermont are becoming an endangered species. The influx of new residents has driven property values sky-high, and as a result, our taxes have soared. This isn’t just about paying more; it’s about what we’re paying for—or rather, what we’re not. Historically, Vermont has boasted some of the best public schools around, but now, with budget cuts left and right, our education system is under threat.

It feels like the newcomers, cruising around in their Rivians and Teslas, don’t share our commitment to community. They say we aren’t friendly! Look in my mirror, my friend! Many of them seem content to bypass our public schools in favor of private education, perpetuating a divide between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots.’ Those of us who have deep roots here are left to struggle with lower wages and higher costs, providing services to a group that doesn’t seem to value what made Vermont special in the first place.

I’m not saying this out of spite—if I’m wrong, I’d be the first to admit it. But after competing against 50 other bidders and paying 25% more just to secure a home here, it’s hard not to feel disillusioned. This was the fourth house we tried to buy, and if we hadn’t succeeded, my frustration would have known no bounds.
I never set out to buy in 2020 but we were already under contract in March 2020, when our seller backed out because they decided not to move. So guess what? A year long scramble ensued while we were basically homeless, living with family looking for the next home.  It’s lucky I made it through that time without killing myself or anyone else. 

So now here we are 5 years later and my trauma is all a distant memory but I can’t help but wonder, will anyone save Vermont? We used to be a state that cared, that looked out for each other, that stood up to greedy developers. What happened to that Vermont? The one that was cool, community-focused, and a little defiant?

I was alone with my oldest child, trying to get dinner home to my wife and our baby. He's super nice guy with super weird politics. His adult sons have looked out for my children in the past. 

Should I have told him to eff off and die? Is that what we're doing here, now, in Vermont? The same state where the presidential electoral votes went for who?

His adult son works at a local non-MAGA shop that employs MAGA boys. Should I boycott them too? Should I go in and tell my good neighbors that they suck for employing MAGA hats? 

Am I supposed to create division with my neighbors while all you guys still shop on Amazon? Sell your shit on Facebook Marketplace? Enjoy your Tesla power walls and electric cars? Should I go vandalize my neighbor's Tesla? The same neighbor who created jobs for 25 locals? The same one who is parents of my son's classmate and friend? Or should I just go tell them that they should feel bad for both creating jobs for MAGA hats and driving a Tesla. That'll show 'em!

1ixdmqk,Please tell your state reps to vote no on Musk-sponsored SB 21,"Hi all,

This bill has been previously discussed in r/Delaware (links below), but I am asking folks to please write your reps at [firstname.lastname@delaware.gov](mailto:firstname.lastname@delaware.gov) to oppose SB 21 (rep finder link below), which will make it much easier for corporate oligarchs to do what they want and take advantage of everyone else. SB 21 has a lot of momentum and has a very high chance of passing if we all don't do something. And unlike happenings in Washington, **this is a state bill where Delawareans have a lot more power to actually stop this**.

Below is an explainer on what SB 21 does and why it's so awful:

**What does SB 21 do?**

This bill does several bad things ([summarized in longer form by Professor Ann Lipton here](https://www.businesslawprofessors.com/2025/02/delaware-decides-delaware-law-has-no-value/)), but perhaps worst of all, this bill allows large, controlling shareholders such as Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and [Larry Ellison](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdurot/2022/10/12/tech-billionaire-larry-ellisons-record-political-giving-funds-election-deniers-in-midterms/) to more easily exploit other investors, including pension funds, 401(k) funds, and ordinary investors.

Under current law, if Mark Zuckerberg were to say, arrange that Meta pay him $20 billion for his college laptop for Meta's corporate museum, shareholders could sue and get the money back. By contrast, if SB 21 is passed, there would be almost nothing shareholders could do so long as a panel of directors (all of whom are hired and fired by Zuckerberg) sign off on the purchase. And of course, after these controlling shareholders plunder the corporate treasury, there's nothing to stop them from [buying (even more) elections](https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-america-pac-trump-d248547966bf9c6daf6f5d332bc4be66). And because a ton of corporations are incorporated (i.e., registered) here, Delaware's corporate laws (and any changes to those laws) apply to all of those corporations.

**Why is SB 21 being proposed now?**

In short, [because Elon Musk lost his lawsuit to keep his now-$100-billion pay package](https://fortune.com/2025/02/21/elon-musk-tesla-pay-package-delaware-courts-change-state-law/). As Governor Meyer (unfortunately, a proponent of the bill) said, ""[It’s really important we get it right for Elon](https://chancerydaily.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=1db63475183f3a61b32348447&id=aa2308fe78&e=a0a17efa4b).""  

**If SB 21 is so bad, why would it even have a chance of passing?**

The short story is that lobbying works, and the ultra-wealthy can do a lot of lobbying.

The long story is that Delaware gets a lot of tax dollars from corporations being incorporated here (note that the corporate tax, or ""franchise fee"" is mostly unrelated to the size of the company and is capped at $200,000 per company). Every year, a handful of  (literally \~5) public companies reincorporate in other states for various reasons, a number that hasn't changed much for over 10 years ([which is as far back as anyone has counted](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4909689), from what I can tell). One of these companies in recent years was Tesla. In particular, Delaware is concerned about losing companies to Nevada, which has recently passed laws that its own legislators said was akin to putting up a sign that says “[sleaze balls and rip off artists welcome here](https://www.reuters.com/article/world/special-report-nevadas-big-bet-on-secrecy-idUSTRE78P1Y0/)."" 

However, more companies continue to move *to* Delaware each year than *away* from Delaware. Delaware continues to have the vast majority of IPOs, and its share of public companies is actually increasing.

Nevertheless, Musk and his lobbyists have grabbed the ears of Delaware's legislators and blown a non-trend into a supposed pending disaster. Your legislators probably don't even know that more companies continue to move to Delaware each year than away from Delaware because that's not a convenient talking more for Musk and company.

**What should I say to my legislator?**

Please tell them that you are opposed to this bill that was[ drafted by Musk's own lawyers](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/18/firm-representing-musk-tesla-drafts-bill-for-delaware-corporate-law.html). Tell them that the ""danger"" to Delaware's corporate franchise taxes is manufactured so Musk can take advantage of ordinary investors for his own ends. Tell them that more companies are moving to Delaware each year than away from it, and not because we've bent the knee for Elon Musk. Tell them to stand up for the values they supposedly professed while campaigning for your vote. Tell them that there are more important things than competing with states like Nevada that [disproportionately attract corporate frauds](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2014/10/28/what-happens-in-nevada-self-selecting-into-lax-law/). Tell them to protect your pensions and investments. Tell them to protect their own pensions and investments. Tell them that Delaware cannot get ahead by racing to the bottom.

Thank you SEIU for bringing this to my attention! I will be pushing more of my efforts there but if anyone wants to voice their displeasure at Elon/DOGE there is a national movement to boycott Tesla.

I submitted this in r/milwaukee last night and think I messed something up and the post got deleted. I am horrified by the actions of Elon Musk/DOGE on the VA in Wisconsin. Many family and friends of mine have depended on this service and the cuts that happened this week to the Zablocki Center really spooked me.

I am going to be holding a sign protesting this in front of the only Tesla dealership in Wisconsin on Silver Spring Drive a few times a week when I can before work. Seeing that Tesla is Elon's bank account, I'm hoping that even getting 1 person to reconsider working with this company will be way to garner attention to this issue. I'm not part of any organization and just want to make sure this message is seen by others.

I started doing this this morning and must say it was quite an experience lol. I certainly could use help adjusting my messaging.

In case anyone else feels the need to join, feel free to be a part of this. I realize that there are many issues that will call people to protest, but I personally will be focusing on this one issue.

Park along South Phelps Road north or south of the bridge. There is sidewalk on both sides of the road. 

I’m sharing this call to action from the organizer of Tesla Takedown KC, a weekly Saturday protest at the Tesla showroom.

Musk is a conman siphoning billions of taxpayer dollars out of critical public services and into his own pockets. And his conflicts of interest are mind boggling. 

Musk and his businesses - SpaceX and its Starlink service, Tesla, and more - have received at least $38 billion in federal funding over the last 20 years, with nearly two-thirds of that promised to Musk’s companies in the past 5 years, according to a recent Washington Post analysis.

“An additional 52 ongoing contracts with seven government agencies — including NASA, the Defense Department and the General Services Administration — are on track to potentially pay Musk’s companies an additional $11.8 billion over the next few years, according to The Post’s analysis.”

1j7hqbn,Supreme Court,"
Why has Elon Musk sunk more than $5 million dollars (and counting) into the Wisconsin Supreme Court race for extreme politician Brad Schimel?

Yes, Musk knows whoever wins the open Supreme Court seat on April 1 will cast the deciding vote in future Court cases.

And, yes, Musk also knows if Schimel wins, he’ll be a rubber stamp for the MAGA agenda in our state. Musk, Donald Trump, and the GOP will have free rein to overturn elections at their whim, re-gerrymander our state, and strip away reproductive rights for Wisconsinites.

But here’s another curious wrinkle. Just five days before Elon Musk dropped his first millions on Schimel, Tesla filed a lawsuit against the State of Wisconsin challenging a state car dealership law.

If the Tesla case goes to the State Supreme Court, how do YOU think the bought-and-paid-for Schimel will vote? No need to guess—you already know the answer.",wisconsin,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/1j7hqbn/supreme_court/,3/9/2025 21:08,942,91,wisconsin

Then the masked man in a gray jacket or hoodie pulled out beer bottles, setting them on fire. He hurled them at three electric vehicle charging ports near 4855 Tanger Outlet Blvd. In the process he set himself on fire, according to police.

1j9m0ij,A cheap pathway toward amnesty for Tesla owners of Vermont.,"Hello Comrades,

Whelp March 12th, another day of new economic lockdowns in the name of public health. Trump's trade quarantines against the world should begin having an effect on the opium trade with China any day now―we'll see who wins this round. 

But we're not here to talk about how our economy woke up and began ""TRANS[itioning]"" under Trump, we're here to figure out wha tto do with the swasticars that we had so much fun of this last month. 

A lot of people missed some of the signs about Elon Musk (over the decades) and became personally financially encumbered in his ideology. And they now they are stuck driving around in a symbol of their mistake, which is awkward for everyone. Like when someone's paypal account gets frozen and everyone just makes fun of them because that's what paypal does.

First. Anyone that can afford to sell their Tesla for any price and buy a new car can just do that―no problem. You don't need amnesty, if you have enough money―'this is America! Just hit send in the app.

Alternatively, locking in a high value donation to a local technical school could be a good way to write down a liability―if there's still an IRS. 

But if the beginning of a recession is not a good financial time for your family, and flipping a vehicle isn't practical financially, there is another way to mark the deprecation in the asset for the books in real life. 

**It's perfectly socially acceptable to own a Tesla, in Vermont, for religious reasons.**

In the United States, everyone has perfect religious freedom to believe WHATEVER they like, including that Elon Musk is the AntiChrist and his loyal followers will be protected in the end times.

If this is the case, please, just let the rest of us know and we'll stop making fun of you... no one will mock you for your religion in Vermont.

Place the mark of the anti-christ (𝕏) on your Tesla, that will be the sign. 

Mark all six sides of your Tesla, so if someone is PoVing overhead, or the vehicle gets flipped, we'll know that you are just a follower of the new Christ and not a Nazi―you'll be as good as one of us.

Treat his mark is the blood of the lamb of freedom and no harm can come to you or your family if you accept it.

But, remember, this is your religion, there are NO RULES. Or rather, they're only rules you make up. 

There can be an upside down メ on the hood, so that it makes a cross visible to the driver. There is no need to stop at one Ｘ on each side, it could be a maximalist wall of xs. It's essentially free art therapy for the cost of a paint pen. The paint pen can just live in the cup holder, or it can be a family activity. It can be a scribble and sip. There are no mistakes, mistakes are good actually. 

It could be like in elementary school where someone broke a bone and everyone signed their cast, except it could be ""I'm broke, so you all have to come mark my Tesla"".

Your Tesla can be a corpus of adornment that expands over months and years. 

To help clue everyone into your religious views, it may be helpful to add some context to the marks, like:

- ""Accept his mark"" 
- ""Elon loves you."" 
- ""Elon gets you.""
- ""Hail Khrist.""
- ""Behold, here is the Khrist""
- ""Behold, He is there""
- ""Hodl 𝕏""

Your goto bible verses (that can sprinkled in anywhere to show that it's a real prophesy and that you're a real religious follower) are as follows:

- Revelation 13:17
- John 4:3
- 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4
- Revelation 13:2
- 2 John 1:7

If you meet a redditor in real life, they may hail you by saying:

> ""Hello Khristian!""

To which the standard response shall be:

> ""Hail Elon! Behold, he is the Khrist. Lead us into temptation and deliver us through evil.""

Or just:

""Behold!""

It is **NOT** decorous to EVER give your heart way, only Khrist should do that gesture.

***

Everyone wants to see your rolling art project. 

It can be posted to any social media that has curated feeds like tiktoc, 𝕏.com, insta or reddit. There should be a timelapse and a behind the scenes.

Facebook will be the goldmine of engagement. It would probably be good to have a Facebook group for doing Christ and Coffee meetups throughout Vermont, in places like Shelburne, Stowe, Woodstock, Manchester, and Killington (anywhere with SuperChargers really).

***

A ""first pass"" deadline for this statewide collaborative art project will be April 12th. They should definitely be well underway by Earth Day 2025.

DO NOT VANDALIZE OTHER PEOPLES' PROPERTY (WITHOUT PERMISSION). 

DON'T LET ANYONE ADMONISH YOU FOR YOUR FAITH, or try to make it political. Remember your catchphrases: ""Behold, He is there"". When you've made it clear you're in a cult, you'll have an opportunity to pivot to listen and ask questions about your neighbor and what their world is like. You can use your rolling conversation piece as a way to connect.

“U.S. Representative Jamie Raskin is encouraging all U.S. citizens to join him this week in filing formal demands for access to their personal data obtained by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and Elon Musk.

The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has issued an injunction commanding DOGE to comply with citizen requests under the Freedom of Information Act. This law encompasses the Federal Privacy Act of 1974, which entitles any citizen to access personal information held in any U.S. government records system. Please find a fillable Privacy Act request form HERE.

Citizens need only fill out the form and mail it in to DOGE.  This newly recognized federal agency, which has been systematically accessing government computer data systems, now has an obligation to respond to specific information demands from any of the 340 million U.S. citizens who exercise their legal right to defend their privacy and establish the security of their private information.

1jaeps3,The Great Tesla 𝕏ing Art Competition kicks off this Saturday. The good party planning committees are forming right now! NO ONE IS GOING TO THE DEALERSHIP!,"END TIMES - Day 74 c.0

**IMPORTANT UPDATE: We know when the rapture occurred.**

On December 29th, 2024, Jesus called home his loyal servant James Earl Carter Jr. to a brand new house built by a master carpenter in the sky. It was an eternal reward for a century of dedicated work furthering the teachings of love and kindness toward others on earth. 

Unfortunately for us leftovers, ol' Jimmy was the last of his faith. 

Now, obviously, there was suppose to be a lot more Christians in the United States when a sky rapture happened. But since we ran out of ""true"" fig bearing fig trees, we're in breach and we began transitioning to the end times immediately. It's ""a rapt"" as the angels say.

Now, so-called Evangelical Christians will be able to process what occurred, because they knew this would happen for decades and they played quite an important role. They can bring everyone up to speed on the end times and the other teachings about the new Christ, if you simply ask them.

***

**New data coming yesterday and overnight:**

Trump said anyone threatening, protesting or boycotting The Christ's businesses is a terrorist that will be prospected under Federal US statues.

There was a prophesy from the oracle: ""dOOON'T gO there.... ahhhh""

And AntifaVT issued a rare ""IT'S A TRAP!"" alert from their old one room school house headquarters.

***

Just to follow up on my [first post yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/vermont/comments/1j9m0ij/a_cheap_pathway_toward_amnesty_for_tesla_owners/), which I realize now might have rushed into the rapture stuff. This is a little more background... 

Since about 1980, some Evangelical Christians have been taught that a series of events will transpire in the near future. And they have all sorts of christian fantasy fiction, movies and shows explaining it. You have to get the current cannon of details from them because it doesn't really track 1:1 with the book of Revelations. 

TL;DR: Evangelicals believe the earth was created about six thousand years ago. Jesus was killed almost two thousand years ago, and the world will end when Jesus comes back and calls all his loyal servants home. 

Now, peddling Jesus in the most agnostic state in the country is not something I'd normally undertake. But Jesus would be MUCH EASIER than hocking The Anti-Christ to the most agnostic state in the Union.

If we arrange all 660k Vermonters on a scale of ""No Jesus for me"" to ""I love Jesus the most"", nowhere on that scale is there a group of people who want to worship the Anti-Christ. Atheists don't care and ""Christians"" won't like him.  So exactly ZERO people should be interested in taking the mark of the Anti-Christ. It should be impossible to get anyone to accept his mark.

Most reasonable people will NOT believe that 100% of Vermonters are going to accept the new Christ because they're confusing him with Jesus. 

Jesus WAS COOL. And lots of people loved him, or didn't, which was fine because loving Jesus was optional. 

The AntiChrist is NOT COOL, and he **NEEDS** EVERYONE to LOVE HIM. 

Everyone must accept his mark. He's not going away. 

If you have any doubts about what I'm saying, just look with your eyes, into the real world. It's a new day and yet ""Behold, here is the Christ"" back to put his mark on everyone.

By Vermonters putting his 𝕏 on their own Teslas in Vermont, they're expressing their love and protecting our state from the wrath of the new Christ. 

Now normally, Jesus is a kiss of death for broad market appeal. But if a marketing team proposed making a CEO a Messiah, that could be worse. 

The only idea that could possibly be **WORSE** for a brand than making a real person the anti-Messiah of an real established popular religion would be if the anti-Messiah was promoting the adoption of a new cryptocurrency. 

And yet, another day. I REPEAT. Behold. Look there *he* IS. 

***

Categories for Vermont's Great 𝕏ing Art competition will be announced tomorrow. 

It's looking like the categories are gonna be: 

- Full Sends - a budget/free/buy-nothing tier with grand ambitions.
- Bōsōzoku but Vermont - for the best exhaust related inspection violations on a Tesla incorporating the symbol X.
- Freedom and Unity - will require a friend with a lifted ICE truck and probably a lot of mud given the season.

Rules are simple: Be SAFE. No hate symbols, no bullying, no violence, no vandalism, NO illegal activity. We're gonna come together and show our love to the new Christ. 

Adults may appear in the final submission photos, but submissions with minors will be immediately removed and the offending team will get +7 years of purgatory. 

No AI please.

Finally, for the graphically inclined, there will be a photoshop battle, which you won't need to be encumbered with a tesla to participate in.

Heat pumps are good for Maine and can save a home thousands of dollars a year by reducing or eliminating the need for heating oil. Last year, Maine’s reliance on heating oil dropped more than 6%. It was the largest annual decrease in decades, and directly tied to heat pump adoption. Despite the decrease, more than 50% of Maine homes still use costly heating oil. Maine imports 80% of our heating oil from Canada. Trump’s tariffs on Canadian oil will balloon the cost, drastically hiking our cost of living. If the GOP spending bill passes, the oligarchs will have unchecked power to unilaterally block congressionally approved funding and implement more tariffs that disproportionately effect Maine.

Maybe I should start reading up on classic liberal/conservative values and policies? Or even have a meaningful dialogue with someone I disagree with? Is there anything else I can do? Or should I just start compromising on my belief system some and try listening to those I disagree with? 

Thank you for any and all opinions

1jc87sm,Tesla Protest - Route 22,"
Just wanted to share my experience at today’s “Tesla Takedown” protest in front of the Tesla showroom/gallery/dealership on Route 22 in Springfield.


I had some of the same thoughts/questions that I saw in posts & comments on Reddit and elsewhere over the past few days: with Route 22 being such an insanely busy highway, where will we stand, will the cops harass us, etc  - but they turned out to be unfounded.  


Everybody stood on the grass near the curb in front of the Tesla building and extending about 50-60 yards down the road in both directions, which I’m pretty sure is a legal place to protest (it’s likely considered a right-of-way or “public square”, especially since there’s a NJ Transit bus stop there; if there was a sidewalk it would unquestionably be legal, so while I’m not 100% sure of the laws regarding public vs private property if there’s no sidewalk I’m fairly confident that the same rules apply).  Nobody was blocking the entrances or exits, standing on or blocking the highway,  interfering with the operation of the business or yelling at/harassing customers or employees, so I don’t think there was much the cops or the company could do about it.  


Cops were there, but they hung out with the Tesla employees near the front of the building and stayed away from the crowd the whole time, with two exceptions: they pulled someone off to the side to discuss a private matter (we recorded just in case), and they had to tell some idiot to keep driving who *stopped her car in the middle of the highway* to yell out her window and argue with us about whether or not Musk is a Nazi, lol.  


Lots of enthusiasm!  The turnout was EXCELLENT - easily 200 to 300 people, maybe more like 400+ at peak but I didn’t walk the line and count so I could be off by a bit.  No negativity, no violence, no trouble or disturbances.  I was really happy to see more than a few people brought American Flags, too, since I’ve long been of the opinion that we need to “take the flag back” from those who have co-opted it.  


Feedback from the people driving by was overwhelmingly positive; drivers were constantly honking horns, raising fists, giving thumbs up, yelling “Fuck Musk”/“Fuck Trump”/etc.  Very few negative reactions from motorists - there were *maybe* 20 or 25 people that gave the finger or yelled something shitty over the entire course of the afternoon.  One woman hurled insults while her toddler in the back seat flipped the bird, which was unsurprising but pretty funny given the cross and praying hands stickers on her rear window.


Just a very positive afternoon overall.  It was so great to see Americans of all stripes & political affiliations stand together in solidarity against the unpatriotic & un-American bullshit this Administration is trying to shove down our throats.  It wasn’t just “angry liberals” in attendance: I spoke with one person who said they were a lifelong Republican voter who just couldn’t stomach the things that are being done right now.  


Such an inspiring and uplifting experience.  Can’t wait for the next one! ",newjersey,https://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/1jc87sm/tesla_protest_route_22/,3/15/2025 23:34,977,190,newjersey

1jcqh8i,"Morgan Griffith (Republican, Va-09) had a tele-town hall on 3/11. Here is the email I sent in response.","Dear Congressman, 

I listened to your tele-town hall on the evening of 3/11. Unfortunately, I did not get selected to speak with you. I do have several follow-up questions & statements that I would like to address with you. 

For some background, I moved to Axton in 2020. In 2022 I accepted permanent custody of my neighbor’s teenage son & have been raising him to have a future & be a respectful member of society. He is now a student at Patrick & Henry Community College & is studying to be a radiology technician. He is a Medicaid recipient, as well as recipient of federal financial aid for his post-secondary education. What are you doing to help protect the health and future of disadvantaged youth? With an education, my ‘foster’ son has a chance to climb out of the poverty he was born in to, to be a self-sufficient, tax paying citizen & to not rely on social assistance programs. But without educational financial aid he cannot achieve any of that. 

In regards to a constituents question during the town hall, and one of Trumps campaign statements, Social Security is ONLY taxable if there’s other income from the recipient or a spouse. If there is additional income, SS is taxed at 85%. Many SS recipients already aren’t paying taxes. 

If a retired teacher who is collecting Social Security (let’s say $2000/month) works part time as a bus driver making minimum wage (let’s say $200/week) will pay 20% tax on his income of $10,400  and 20% tax on $20,400 of his SS. Yet, Tesla paid zero in federal tax in 2024, despite earning $2.3 billion. How is this fair? What reasonable person would think this is okay?

Elon Musk is taking a slash & burn approach to government agencies & programs. I understand that there is some wasteful government spending. As a child in the 70s I recall my parents discussing a news article that pointed out the absurd cost for replacing a toilet on Air Force One or some other toilet. A single bolt was an astronomical price. You talked about getting rid of the bean counters. Is anyone making sure that the jobs being eliminated are actually wasteful & Americans will benefit in any way? Instead of hiring forensic accountants, complete agencies were fired without thought for the repercussions. You called them glitches. I would say that firing nuclear scientists, the CDC experts who were working on the Ebola virus, FAA administration, air traffic controllers, and FDA inspectors AND then realizing that, oops, we actually do need those people and scrambling to get them back is more than a glitch. I’d call it reckless, irresponsible and dangerous. These glitches, as you call them, are endangering citizens of this country, our safety & our national security. What is your justification for cutting government spending to the detriment of us all? Why is it acceptable to slash & burn our government and then backtrack with no regard to how it affects hard-working Americans, our disabled veterans, our elderly, our children & our future? 

Grants for farmers have been reduced or eliminated. Small generational farms & ranches are going bankrupt, which will make the US more dependent on imports. That is taking jobs directly out of the hands of Americans. Services for our veterans, our heroes, are being drastically slashed & mental & physical health services will not be available to them. Please explain how this will help us & our future generations? 

You stated that President Trump is pushing through his agenda at an accelerated speed because he failed on many policies during his first term. That appears to be retaliatory behavior and not in the best interest of the people who voted for him. He has 4 years in office. He does not need to assault the American people with new, mind-boggling, economy busting politics every day. He could take some time to roll out his policies in a more productive manner that won’t leave the most vulnerable citizens without assistance. Why is President Trump concerning himself with paper vs plastic straws while children go to sleep hungry at night? 

You talked about the national debt & the debt ceiling. You stated that all these federal cuts will go directly to reducing our debt. However, if this administration is so keen on reducing national debt, why is the President spending $20 million to attend the Super Bowl & $18 million to go golfing every weekend? How is that responsible spending? How is that not waste & abuse while a single parent has their SNAP benefits cut? Why is Elon Musk making personal use, without the President, of Air Force One & Marine One to travel to the White House? Surely the richest man in the world can afford his own private jet & helicopter and not travel on the tax-payers dime. 

I’d like to understand why you support billionaires paying only a tiny fraction of the taxes they should be paying while American families can’t afford life saving medication for their critically ill children. Please explain how slashing agencies & programs that help Americans is the preferred debt reduction avenue of this Administration, whereas billionaires are given a free pass in taxes. 

The First Amendment of the US Constitution protects the freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to assembly & the right to petition. A caller on your town hall specifically asked about putting signs up and protesting at medical facilities that offer abortion. You gave her suggestions. I’d like to know how you will protect American citizens who assemble & protest governmental actions. Politicians talk about protecting our Second Amendment rights, but how about the First Amendment?President Trump has threatened institutions of higher education if their students protest. That is a clear violation of the Constitution. Women are being dragged out of town hall meetings with their congressmen for speaking their minds or simply holding a sign about Jesus. How will you address this matter? How will you protect our rights that are listed in the constitution? 

I’m also interested in how the Commonwealth will be raising the money needed to fund Virginia’s public schools, Medicaid for minors in foster care, and cover the unemployment benefits of the thousands of government employees who have lost their jobs. The economy of our state will be drastically impacted by the federal cuts. It does not seem like our elected officials are doing anything to protect the Commonwealth you were elected to serve. 

My final point is regarding DOGE oversight & accountability. From what I understand DOGE is billing the federal government approximately $9 million per week for expenses. Expenses, not salaries. What expenses are the staffers actually incurring? The American people have a right to know what these expenses are. We have been told that Elon Musk will self determine if his DOGE role has a conflict of interest with his companies. Yet over the last several weeks Elon Musk’s companies have been awarded lucrative government contracts. I’d also like to point out that DOGE eliminated the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as well as other agencies that were investigating Musk’s companies. How is this not self serving & a clear violation of conflict of interest? How does this protect the American public & make our lives better? 

I appreciate you reading my letter. I am requesting that you, please, do not send a form letter in response. I’ve put a lot of thought & time into drafting this email. I look forward to hearing back from you specifically addressing my concerns, with as much detail as possible. Please do not insult my intelligence by simply stating that all of this will help our country. I’d like to understand how all of this is beneficial and how you will protect the residents of your district. 

I hope you will join me in standing with Ukraine, as they were invaded by Russia and have a right to defend their country & their democracy. ",Virginia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Virginia/comments/1jcqh8i/morgan_griffith_republican_va09_had_a_teletown/,3/16/2025 17:19,158,22,virginia

1jdens2,Trump Derangement Syndrome Legislation Update!,"This is a repost from last night, as I had to remove the social media link.

This is in reference to: [https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?f=sf2589&b=senate&y=2025&ssn=0](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?f=sf2589&b=senate&y=2025&ssn=0)

As of yesterday afternoon, **this amendment to Mn statute 245 has been rejected!** Below is the text from Senator Melissa Wiklund's BlueSky account in response to a Star Tribune article:

***""The bill was referred to the committee I chair, I won’t be scheduling it for a hearing. We do important work in SenateHHS and listen to Minnesotans who come to us with urgent needs for better access to mental health care. Trivializing a serious issue to make a point is disrespectful & disheartening.""***

There was discussion in the original post about the feasibility of this proposal, including that it was essentially dead from the beginning. This is likely, though as we've been seeing, many things that we've never thought could come to pass have and are doing so now under this administration. Regardless, what we can count on is that this was a ripple check -- this was a group of Republican senators who introduced something that, had it gained real traction, could have set an alarming precedent.

**Even if this bill was never going anywhere, here is some reality:**

\- folks in Minnesota came out in FORCE against this.

\- senators were called

\- news media was contacted. I found numerous local papers running the story, and I found it on a national blog. Because this became a NATIONAL story, this may expose other such legislation in other states, and inhibit its ability to go forward.

\- this was cross-posted to social media everywhere and gained immense traction

\- the chair of this committee saw the news story, made a decision, and posted on her personal social media on a Sunday afternoon to tell Minnesotans that she heard us, and dismiss this publicly.

\- these five Republican senators wasting taxpayer time in an era of great need in this country have been outed for the fools they are.

I want you all to know how amazing you are and how inspired I am by everyone who took ownership of this and stood up for what you believe. The most important thing here, in my opinion, is that we CAN be heard even in times when our free speech is under attack when we COME TOGETHER.

We cannot stop, my friends. This is a vastly important time for us to be one voice, and to be louder than the authoritarian machine. There are protests and actions all over Minnesota, all across the United States, and plenty of ways for you to be involved. And we WILL prevail. When the time comes for us to stand against some other egregious act, we're ready.

LASTLY! Please remember to call your politicians to PRAISE them when they listen to us! Senator Wiklund can be reached at: 651-297-8061",minnesota,https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/1jdens2/trump_derangement_syndrome_legislation_update/,3/17/2025 14:59,3835,375,minnesota

I am writing this post to encourage citizens to join me in protesting the presidents unlawful and unconstitutional actions. The president recently acted in direct opposition of a federal court order to return deported “Venezuelan gang members” to the United States from a prison in El Salvador. A president has never acted in direct opposition to a federal court order. This is a giant step towards authoritarianism, and a disgrace to our democratic system of government.

1jf6srz,Anti-Tesla Action IL,"I know a lot of folks have been participating in the Tesla Takedown protests across Illinois but I think there are a couple of additional things we could do to put pressure on the company. Most of them involve writing to your representatives about looking into legislative solutions for problems raised by Tesla.

1.) Tesla gathers data on its drivers by tying it in to features that they need to opt in to. Ask your legislators to require that companies disclose this at the moment of purchase in the form of a label or other visible and unavoidable marker. I think most people buying cars don’t yet associate them as possible privacy risks in the way they do phones or computers and more could be done to safeguard consumers.

2.) Teslas utilize exterior cameras to train their driverless functions. They openly acknowledge that data from your vehicle is being transmitted to their servers to help it get better at identifying roadside hazards. Presumably this includes humans, but are we certain that it’s only the shape of or skin tone of humans and not actually our faces? Unlike backup or side cameras, these are not closed circuit and are transmitted away from the vehicle. If they are tracking faces this could be a violation of the Illinois BIPA law. 

3.) There should also be greater regulation of how Tesla handles its internal data given they’ve had abuses in the past where embarrassing or harmful videos were shared amongst employees. https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-workers-shared-sensitive-images-recorded-by-customer-cars-2023-04-06/

1jg2uq4,Save the Libraries. Save the Future.,"
Please do your part in helping the poor people, of this bass ackwards state, not become dumber than they already are. The brain drain is real, whether you choose to acknowledge it or not. Please, at least give our children a chance at having a better life. That chance can only begin with the ability to read and experiencing things that only books can offer. 


May it perish not, the strongholds of the literate and hopeful. The wonderlands, curated for curiosity. May the vast power of knowledge contained within these vessels of wisdom be wielded, forthwith, by those whose books are now destined to serve as shields. Those whose stamps are now fashioned as swords. The chosen ones, who really just enjoy books and helping people, must now endure and persevere against the tyranny of smug and self-entitled imbeciles empowered by unrighteous arrogance. An arrogance so unbecoming, that it can only be matched by their blatant love of ignorance. May our children read themselves into a brighter future and not succumb to the frivolous folly of the news of foxes, that leads so many astray for pay. May they not become ensnared and entangled by sinister southern tomfoolery that begets bigotry. May they not be absorbed by the metastatic tumors, adorning fancy suits, who seek to fortify their ravenously tax consuming, cancerous, conservative poppycock within our institutions. Those who remain set on engulfing and exploiting our abilities to remain reasonable, patient, and decent as people. May our children not fall prey amongst the politically wretched and join the ever growing plethora of closed minded and terminally moronic masses of puppets that proudly regurgitate nonsense propaganda and rejoice at the suffering of others, even if it is at the expense of their own best socioeconomic interests, because they refuse to acknowledge the enabling, team sport parasitic creatures (that plague and rob sane people of time, patience, money, and air) that they have become… 

Yes, ye brave defenders of literature, may you be victorious in the metaphorical smiting of that oppressive ass that seeks your demise. May you save the joy of libraries for future generations. And may you savor the joy of forcing these Nazi’s to get Sieg Heil out of our lives. 

If anybody, who took the time to read the above, had significant trouble following, then you may be part of the reason we need libraries to stay in existence in here.",Louisiana,https://actionnetwork.org/letters/protect-louisiana-library-funding-save-imls?source=direct_link&,3/20/2025 23:24,36,15,louisiana
1jgb4b0,Why do the busses around the Puget Sound area always cruise in the left lane?,"Seriously, they freaking sit in the passing lane with an entire stream of traffic behind who would like to go 5-10 over, not 5 under.

One is in Devon, PA at 11am-12pm and the other is in West Chester 1pm-3pm.

These protests are PEACEFUL, fun and do not involve vandalism or preventing the entry of customers to the showrooms. We welcome Tesla owners and have had many friendly honks from Tesla drivers who aren't happy with Musk.

Bernie Merch for Sale at My Local Coffee Shop,"Just walked into a Dunkin’ Donuts here in Massachusetts, expecting to grab a coffee, and instead, I’m greeted by a table full of Bernie Sanders T-shirts for sale. Seriously? Since when did Dunkin’ turn into a political merch shop? I came here for a coffee, not a socialist campaign rally.

1jknaif,Someone hit my car and left while I watched.  Police said they'll do nothing.,"Someone's kid opened their car door into my parked car while when I was about 10 feet away (Gymnastics pickup).  I yelled about it, and the lady already in the drivers seat starts backing out and says: ""She didn't hit your car."" through the glass at me.  Basically I could only read her lips.

The she drove away.

I have her license plate because I took a picture of the crappy parking job she did, thinking it was comical.

My car has a noticeable chip in the paint.

I called the police in the town where it happened, and they said to come into the station the next day to get the report filed.

I did that, and the officer gave me a salad of excuses why he couldn't do anything.

""It's private property.""  
""They Gymnastics place doesn't have cameras, so I can't prove anything.""  
""She can just say she didn't do it.""

None of that makes sense to me.  My property was damaged. It took a very long time to get the officer to take the report, and get him to understand that he is not the person who determines what is true.  That's what a judge does.

Though he absolutely assured me that this persons contact information will not be in the police report.

The damage isn't enough to involve insurance, so how do I find out who the person is to hold them accountable?

1jl3jfj,Luxury hotel guest's cowardly backtracking caught on cam after he was 'caught keying Tesla' in NH,"""A luxury hotel guest was filmed denying he keyed a Tesla Cybertruck just moments after he was caught on camera vandalizing the vehicle in the parking lot of a luxury hotel in New Hampshire.

Carroll Police Chief Tadd Bailey told the New Hampshire Union Leader the incident happened on Saturday, March 22.

'The incident is under investigation by us and the Coos County Attorney’s Office,' Bailey said. 

However, the chief did not say whether there have been any arrests or charges stemming from the incident.

Attacks on property carrying the logo of Musk’s electric-car company are cropping up across the US and overseas. While no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted.

On Monday, multiple incendiary devices were found inside a Tesla showroom in Austin, Texas.
Prosecutors in Colorado charged a woman last month in connection with attacks on Tesla dealerships, including Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles and the words 'Nazi cars' spray-painted on a building.

An Oregon man faces charges after allegedly throwing several Molotov cocktails at a Tesla store in Salem, then returning another day and shooting out windows. In the Portland suburb of Tigard, more than a dozen bullets were fired at a Tesla showroom last week, damaging vehicles and windows, the second time in a week that the store was targeted.

Four Cybertrucks were set on fire in a Tesla lot in Seattle earlier this month. On Friday, witnesses reported a man poured gasoline on an unoccupied Tesla Model S and started a fire on a Seattle street.

In Las Vegas, several Tesla vehicles were set ablaze early Tuesday outside a Tesla service center where the word “resist” was also painted in red across the building’s front doors. Authorities said at least one person threw Molotov cocktails — crude bombs filled with gasoline or another flammable liquid — and fired several rounds from a weapon into the vehicles.""

We quickly put together a design, got it approved by the [Mass50501](https://www.mass50501.com/) team, and cleared it with the advertising company’s legal team. This morning, I signed the final paperwork—so the billboard will be going up in Brockton and should be visible starting Monday morning!

We’ve started a GoFundMe to help cover the cost—turns out billboards are kind of expensive—so if you’re able to chip in, we’d really appreciate the support:

1jnkmv9,Will Not Vote for Walz Again,"Two time Walz for Governor voter. Have never regretted that, especially vs Jensen. Also voted for him for VP. Kamala was incredibly qualified. 

The Tesla fight bothered me. He's lost in his hate. Democrats will say ""oh, but the hate on the right"", and the Republicans will say ""oh but the hate on the left"". 

And in a sense, both sides are right. But I don't give a **** about whataboutisms. 

My expectations was for Walz to govern and focus on MN. I didn't vote for him to go on a nationwide tour and act like a prick, like 3 months into the new presidency. 

My expectations are pretty simple. Don't actively hope an American company fails because you hate a guy. Hundreds of thousands will be hurt more than Elon if Tesla fails. Including tens of thousands that want to help reduce our carbon footprint (and yes, EVs even with battery development are SIGNIFICANTLY better for the environment than gas).  I know some of these people. It's BS for Walz to have said what he said and try and act like it was all a joke. 

I suspect there are thousands in MN that feel this same way. I know this sub, as well as reddit, leans extremely left. And that's fine. 

But don't be shocked when quite a few typically democrat-backing voters go the other way next time or sit out. When you're wrong, say you're wrong. And if you can't, you're not worth my vote or my time. 


Edit: I'm actually so glad I posted this because it proved my point. Republicans and Democrats are the exact same on the extremes. Minnesota will vote Republican, this sub will be absolutely shocked, and on it will go. Zero self awareness in the first 25 comments. Literally 0 for 25. Oh well.
