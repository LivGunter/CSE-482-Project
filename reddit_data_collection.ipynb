My lease was up and due to recent developments with Elon and the staleness of having a Tesla (including a model 3 before) for the last 5 years; it was time for a change. \\n\\nLast night I made the jump and signed a lease of a 2024 Equinox EV 2RS all black. My lease isn’t up for a month and I just went to look and test drive anyway. I drove it and was blown away. It feels remarkably similar to my Dual Motor model Y but the interior quality was better. Loved every bit of it. It even has super cruise. The only option it’s lacking that I wish it had is the panoramic sunroof. \\n\\nI feel like I got a great deal (I negotiated pretty hard). 24 month lease with $315 per month lease with $0 down, 10,000 miles. All in all, spending $120 less per month than my Tesla. Very happy! ',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Musk is the CEO and public face of Tesla. Back in it early days (pre-2018) he was awkward but enthusiastic, progressive and apolitical. You would buy a Tesla-made car because it was different, fun, fast, smart and relatively green. The company as led by Musk kick-started the electric car as a viable option and revolutionised the car industry.\\n\\nNow, Musk has gone down a very murky rabbit hole. His public face is less about his companies, and more about his politics. He has huge influence, and not in a way the most of the world wants.\\n\\nA European study has shown that 30% of Tesla owners in the Netherlands are considering selling their car or have already done so. Tesla sales in Q4 2024 are down 40% compared to the previous year. Global sales are down 1.1%, the first ever drop in sales since 2011.\\n\\nAnecdotally, in Australia, everyone I have talked to has said they would not consider buying a Tesla now. Tesla sales in Australia for 2024 are down 1.5% for the model 3 and 26% for the model Y.\\n\\nThere are many reasons why this decline could be occurring. Interest rates are still up. The Model Y refresh is pending. But I think a huge part is the disenchantment of buyers because of Musk's public face.\\n\\n  \\nI think Musk should go. Musk is damaging Tesla. He should not be CEO. I think as shareholders we should protect our interests and vote for him to be removed as CEO. \",\n",

Tesla’s brand value dropped by $15 billion in 2024, a massive loss that signals a shift in public perception. The endless delays, price cuts, quality control issues, and Musk’s erratic behavior have eroded consumer trust.\\n\\nLet’s not forget the PR nightmare of endless recalls, self-driving crashes, and Musk’s alienation of core demographics.

       "  'selftext': 'https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/22/tech/elon-musk-trump-stargate-openai/index.html\\n\\n> Shortly after President Donald Trump announced a new massive AI infrastructure investment from the White House, “First Buddy” Elon Musk tried to tear it down. “They don’t actually have the money,” Musk wrote on his social media platform X. “SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.”\\n\\n> Trump said the investment will create a new company, called Stargate, to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States. The leaders of SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle stood alongside Trump during the announcement. Their respective companies will invest $100 billion in total for the project to start, with plans to pour up to $500 billion into Stargate in the coming years.\\n\\n> Perhaps it should not be a surprise that Musk is going after an OpenAI initiative. Musk is in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman, who was at the White House for the announcement. Musk, who has said he “doesn’t trust” Altman, claims in the lawsuit the ChatGPT has abandoned its original nonprofit mission by reserving some of its most advanced AI technology for private customers. The companies involved in Stargate have not publicly disclosed how they will contribute the funds, but they don’t necessarily need the money in the bank to support it — they could raise debt or sign on other equity investors.',\n",

       "  'selftext': \"Was fortunate enough to recently complete a buyback with Tesla for our X Plaid. I had originally wanted a Rivian but we had a lease on a Y coming up and access to the shop wasn't fully open yet so timing didn't work. Tesla had also just slashed the price on the MXP so I got suckered in by Elon. Needless to say, the car was a mess and exactly 1 year later Tesla was cutting me a refund check. \\n\\nTook delivery of a Dual Large Performance a couple weeks ago and have absolutely been loving the experience. I guess for anybody who's in an X and is looking to ditch their Swastikar, here are some of my observations after 800 miles:\\n\\n1. Space: Space in the X is abysmal. The egg shape and the fact that we couldn't fold the second row flat in the Plaid really limited what we could carry. Plus no storage on those stupid Falcon Wing Doors. The powered frunk on the Rivian is an absolute game changer. I rarely used the frunk on my X because it was manual close and I don't like touching my car's paint if I don't absolutely need to. The open storage between the driver and passenger is also incredibly useful. My partner and I have two dogs so it's a great place to throw leashes, water bottles, bags. You can't imagine how much easier life is when you can just throw things in your car and go. Not having the glovebox is wild to me but it's a small thing.\\n\\n2. No more silly doors: the Falcon Wing Doors are the dumbest thing and I am so happy I don't have to deal with them anymore. I can't tell you how many times I've had to grab the door to prevent it from slamming into a concrete pillar or how many times I've had to take it into the service center to have the sensors fixed and ultimately replaced. They're a PITA to live with and I felt like a complete douche each time I opened them in public. Yes, ingress and egress are amazing with the FWD, but they're unnecessarily complicated and bound to break. \\n\\n3. Interior: this is the interior of a 6 figure vehicle (sans the squeaks). I've grown tired of Tesla's minimal interior. Again, I feel like it's a hat trick. It was cool in the beginning because it was new but now it's just lazy and boring. I love having textures and materials with pops of accent color. It's a well thought out space and a great place to spend time. Got the Ocean Coast interior and can't get enough of the blue/grey tint to the material. It adds a bit of warmth/depth. The Tesla white looks sterile. I do not miss the huge windshield with those ridiculous sunshades - how much time is anybody spending staring at the sky when driving anyway? \\n\\n4. Ride: ride is great. I prefer being higher up and being able to see the end of the hood. Read stories of the Gen 1 suspension so whatever they did to the suspension in Gen 2 worked. I've had the Model Y and an M2 so I'm familiar with stiff suspension - this is pretty plush to me. Even in sport I don't feel like it's excessively stiff. The X rides more like a car so getting in and out of the Rivian took some getting used to. Installing running boards over the long weekend. \\n\\n5. Performance: was on the fence about a tri or dual and ended up with the dual performance. Tesla acceleration is intense. No qualms about that. There were times when I'd floor it in the Plaid and literally feel the blood rushing to the back of my head. It was pretty cool, I'm not gonna like. But it didn't serve a purpose other than being faster or potentially getting me into trouble. The performance in the dual performance is more than enough and I don't plan on doing anything more than light off-roading. In the end, I don't feel the need to be boy racer in my Rivian. I'm perfectly happy casually cursing in my luxury daddy-mobile. \\n\\n6. Regenerative breaking: I love having the regenerative on high and the confidence that this car will stop in a short distance. The regenerative on the X was never enough and I found myself needing to activate the brake more often. Plus Tesla no longer allows drivers to select their preferred regenerative levels.  \\n\\n7. Tech: Tesla tech is just more mature. There's no getting around it. Coming into a Gen 2 it's nice to see the direction Rivian is going. I miss the snappiness of the Tesla system, better routing, and superior sound system. The premium audio in the Rivian is not premium right now. That being said, I like Rivian's approach to design. It's more thoughtful and inviting. I'm also exited that Rivian is in a time of rapid change. There's a lot to look forward to and I'm also excited to be part of a community that's filled with anticipation for things to come. Whatever small features I miss from my Tesla, like auto tilting mirrors, is already in Rivian's roadmap so it's only a matter of time for things to equal out. They just REALLY need to do something about this sound system. \\n\\n8. Elon: don't need to say much here. Just happy to be a Tesla-free household. \\n\\nOverall my partner and I are incredibly happy. This is a fantastic car that has its small quirks but is far exceeding our expectations. \",\n",

       "  'selftext': 'Tesla’s dominance in the EV market is slipping, and nowhere is that more obvious than in China. According to a new report from CNBC, Tesla’s sales in China dropped 11.5% this January compared to the same time last year. With China setting the pace for the global EV industry, Tesla is rapidly losing ground to local giants like BYD.\\n\\nIt’s not just a sales dip, it’s a wipeout. In January, BYD sold 30% more EVs than Tesla worldwide. The reason? Cost and variety.\\n\\nWhile Tesla leans on price cuts to compete, Chinese brands like BYD are already priced lower from the start. Tesla’s profit margins, once its strong suit, are shrinking fast, while BYD keeps scaling production without sacrificing profitability. The Model 3 and Model Y Tesla’s core models are struggling to hold their own against a flood of cheaper, high-tech, government-backed alternatives.\\n\\nFor years, Tesla thrived under China’s policies that welcomed foreign EV makers. That era is over. The Chinese government has made it clear, they want their own brands to lead the global EV race. Companies like BYD, Nio, and XPeng are now the priority, while Tesla is increasingly seen as an outsider.\\n\\nTesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory, once a strategic advantage, is now a vulnerability. The Chinese government could tighten regulations, cut subsidies, or tilt the playing field even further in favor of domestic competitors, any of which would weaken Tesla’s foothold even more.\\n\\nElon’s strategy of constant price cuts has helped sustain demand, but the latest 11.5% sales drop suggests the approach is losing its effectiveness. Cutting prices again and again doesn’t build brand loyalty.. It signals that demand is slipping.\\n\\nAnd Tesla can’t keep squeezing its margins forever. The competition isn’t slowing down it’s accelerating.',\n",

Additionally, if a Democrat wins the next presidential election, there’s a real possibility that the DOJ could bring criminal charges against Musk. Many state attorneys general could also file lawsuits in the future.\\n\\nI hope Musk reconsiders his controversial posts on X and shifts his focus back to Tesla, but I suspect he’s miscalculated the consequences of his actions.',\n",

       "  'title': 'Former Tesla Employee Here: A Few Tips for Model Y Owners',\n",
       "  'selftext': \"Hey everyone! (Please remove ADMIN if not allowed, hoping this helps folks)\\n\\nAs a former Tesla employee (these are expressly my views), I thought I’d share some insights and tips that might help you get the most out of your Model Y. These are based on things I learned while working at Tesla and from my own experiences as an owner. (I have owned two M3 and two MY). One of the best cars I have ever owned.\\n\\n(All pictures will be of a 2022 Model Y Long Range)\\n\\n1. **Register Your Tires**: Many people don’t know this, but you can (and should) register your tires with their respective manufacturers. If your tires don’t reach their expected mileage, you might be eligible for warranty claims. I’ve personally seen 10-25% of the cost covered through these claims. It’s an easy process and can save you some cash down the line. You can do so usually online through the company website (I have done both Goodyear and Michelin with my MXM4 and my Eagle FS-1). If you see the picture of my tires this is after 33K miles and they are still at tread depth of 4-5mm for all. ***\\\\*FOR CLARITY IT DOES NOT WORK in all cases, HOWEVER I have had luck with Michelin and Goodyear from experience\\\\****\\n2. **Take Advantage of Form 8911**: If you installed a home EV charger, you may qualify for a federal tax credit using IRS Form 8911. This credit can offset a significant chunk of the cost, so definitely check it out if you haven’t already! the credit for each item of property is generally the smaller of 30% of the property's cost or $1,000. Check with a tax pro, worth the ask!\\n3. **Protect Your Air Intake**: One of the most common out-of-warranty repairs I saw involved debris getting into the air intake. This can cause costly damage, but it’s preventable! You can install grill covers or mesh to protect your air intake and keep out debris. It’s a small investment that could save you a lot of money. ($2500-3500 for the repair and it is NOT warranty covered if due to DAMAGE by debris) ***EDIT: FOR CLARITY it is on the front fascia below the frunk, the GRILLE as you would call it on a traditional car, as long with the intake under the frunk itself I clean consistently. :)***\\n4. **Maximizing Your Range**: If you’re not hitting the range you’d like, here are two easy ways to improve it:\\n   * **Proper Tire Inflation**: Keep your tires inflated to the recommended PSI. Underinflated tires can reduce range significantly. (42-44 PSI is usually where they sit). See the photos I have included my tires are showing visible \\\\*wear\\\\* they considered this (Goodyear) as cosmetic but still offered me 20% off my next set via warranty at 33,000 miles.\\n   * **Precondition While Charging**: If you precondition your car while it’s still plugged in, you’ll use less battery power to warm things up, which helps extend range. I’ve been able to consistently get 270-280 miles this way going 75-77 MPH on highway with air / heat between 1-3 setting. (This is at temperatures in the high desert of 40 - 75 degrees).\\n\\nLastly I provided my current KWH usage over the lifetime of my car. For context I live in PHX so it is 100-120 about 4 months out of the year, then I also life part time in Flagstaff which can be 10-40 degrees. So my car has been in both extremes and still manage to do pretty well. :)\\n\\nAdditionally last thing for context. I charge at home for about 95% of my charging which on average is $0.16 per KWH. If you intend to supercharge to save money... you will not save money over gas assuming like 30 MPG and gas below about $3.00 (on average) a gallon. COMMON MISCONCEPTION.\\n\\nCharging for lifetime of car:\\n\\n\\\\~$1500 at Home at \\\\~0.16 per KWH\\n\\n\\\\~$3200.... if it was ALL supercharging at \\\\~$.33-.35 (on average) can be up to $.45.\\n\\nA $1700 difference just by using home charging which paid for my install (not including tax credit).\\n\\nI hope these tips are helpful! If anyone has questions or their own advice to share, let’s hear it. This Model Y community is awesome, and I’m always happy to contribute. 🚘✨\",\n",

The fund, which manages assets of around USD 1.8 trillion and holds a significant stake in Tesla, voted against Musk’s compensation proposal, prompting him to admonish CEO Nicolai Tangen not to request any “favors” until making amends.\\n\\nIn their exchange, Musk also accused Tangen of leaking the texts to the media, after Norwegian outlets reported on his canceled dinner appearance at the Oil Fund’s investment conference. Tangen countered that Norway’s strict transparency laws, akin to the U.S. Freedom of Information Act, required partial disclosure, including confirmation that Musk would not attend.\\n\\nInitially, the Oil Fund classified much of the conversation as private and withheld it. However, in the spirit of transparency, they eventually released all texts. The incident highlights the tension between Musk’s calls for discretion and the Norwegian Oil Fund’s legal obligations to remain open. While emphasizing a positive relationship with Tesla as a critical investment, the fund has reiterated its opposition to Musk’s pay plan.',\n",

       "  'selftext': 'I’ve been following Elon Musk’s career for years. As someone who values innovation and believes in the power of business to drive positive change, I used to admire his vision for Tesla and the broader push toward sustainable energy. But lately, I can’t ignore how his political realignment is actively damaging Tesla’s brand and alienating its core supporters.\\n\\nA recent study from the American EV Jobs Alliance highlights a drastic shift in Musk’s public perception. While he has gained favor among Republicans, he has become highly unpopular with Democrats—historically, the group most supportive of EV adoption. The data shows that gasoline car and pickup truck drivers now rate him far higher than EV owners, and he has a particularly low favorability rating among voters who prioritize climate change. This is a major shift from where Tesla started, appealing primarily to environmentally conscious consumers and those seeking to move away from fossil fuels. \\n\\nBeyond public perception, this shift is having real consequences for Tesla’s market position. The study found that brands like Ford and Toyota are now more popular among likely future EV buyers than Tesla. That’s an alarming trend for a company that once dominated the EV space. Musk’s political moves—whether it’s openly embracing culture war rhetoric or his increasingly combative stance against environmental policies—seem to be driving away the very people Tesla depends on.\\n\\nIt’s not just a branding issue; it’s a business issue. Tesla’s competitive advantage was built on early adopters who cared about innovation and sustainability. But those same customers are now turning elsewhere, and the numbers show it. If Tesla continues down this path, its ability to lead the EV market long-term is in serious jeopardy.\\n\\nI used to believe Musk was a visionary committed to advancing sustainable technology. But it’s becoming increasingly clear that his priorities have shifted, and in the process, he’s putting Tesla’s future—and its original mission—at risk.',\n",

Just curious if there are any analysis that indicate whether this is affecting Tesla sales more broadly?\\n\\nTesla market share in the United States is about half the EV’s sold now, and has been declining as other automakers produce decent cars with good range, which also do the other ‘car things’ well.\\n\\nBut that was happening way before everyone’s opinions changed about Musk, and seems to be mostly in line with what one would expect with greater competition the market.\\n\\nThe people with the bumper stickers, I imagine are also people who are fairly politically motivated, who were early adaptors of EV’s, etc. I’m not sure we can read too much into that, because it’s tiny minority, and as EV’s become more mainstream, that will not be the median buyer.\\n\\nThere will be buyers who are alienated, and those who are attracted, by his political activity.  Does this have a discernable net effect outside the expected trendline of market forces at work?',\n",
